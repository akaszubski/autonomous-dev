markers =
    unit: Unit tests for individual functions
    integration: Integration tests for workflows
    slow: Tests that take a long time to run
    hooks: Tests for hook functionality
    smoke: Smoke tests - fast validation of critical paths (tier 0)
    regression: Regression tests - protect released features from breaking (tier 1)
    extended: Extended tests - deeper validation scenarios (tier 2)
    progression: Progression tests - validate new feature development (tier 3)
    tdd_red: TDD red phase tests (expected to fail before implementation)
    timeout: Tests with execution time limits
    genai: GenAI-powered UAT tests (may incur API costs, requires --genai flag)
