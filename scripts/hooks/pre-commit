# Pre-commit hook - Validate repository structure
#
# This hook ensures files are in the correct locations:
# - User docs in plugins/autonomous-dev/docs/
# - Dev docs in docs/
# - No duplicates between root and plugin
# - Clean root directory
#
# To install this hook:
#   ln -sf ../../scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
#
# To bypass (emergency only):
#   git commit --no-verify

set -e

echo "🔍 Validating repository structure..."

# Run structure validation
python scripts/validate_structure.py

# If validation passes, allow commit
exit $?
