  - Separate from failures: Skipped features don't trigger retries
  - Parameters: feature_index, reason, category (quality_gate, manual, dependency)
  - Updates batch_state.json skipped_features field
  - Thread-safe with file locking (consistent with mark_feature_status)
  - Use cases: Skip after max retries, security failures, manual exclusions

- New retry_history field in RalphLoopState (#256)
  - Track all retry attempts in Ralph Loop sessions
  - Each attempt records timestamp, iteration number, tokens used, status
  - Enables audit trail for self-correcting agent execution
  - Helps debug which attempts succeeded/failed

### Deprecated
- RALPH_LOOP_ENABLED environment variable (opt-in pattern)
  - Still works via is_ralph_loop_enabled() logic, but redundant
