# Setup Wizard - Templates

Templates for PROJECT.md generation.

---

## PROJECT.md Generation Template

Use this structure when generating PROJECT.md from codebase analysis:

```markdown
# Project: [Detected from README]

**Last Updated**: [Today's date]
**Version**: [From package.json/pyproject.toml or "0.1.0"]
**Status**: [Infer from git activity: Active/Stable/Development]

---

## PROJECT VISION

[Extract from README.md "About" or "Description" section]

### What Problem Does This Solve?

[Extract from README "Why" or "Problem" section]

### Who Is This For?

[Extract from README "Audience" or infer from project type]

---

## GOALS

**Primary Goals**:
1. [Goal 1 - from README or infer from codebase]
2. [Goal 2]
3. [Goal 3]

**Success Metrics**:
- [Metric 1 - e.g., "80%+ test coverage"]
- [Metric 2 - e.g., "< 100ms API response"]

---

## SCOPE

### In Scope
- [Feature 1 - detected from src/ structure]
- [Feature 2 - detected from API routes]

### Out of Scope
**TODO**: Define what's explicitly out of scope.

---

## ARCHITECTURE

### System Design
- **Pattern**: [Detected: Layered/Microservices/Monolith]
- **Components**: [List main directories/modules]

### Tech Stack

**Languages**: [Detected with percentages]
**Frameworks**: [Backend, Frontend, Testing]
**Tools**: [Build, Linting, CI/CD]

---

## FILE ORGANIZATION

```
[Project root]
├── src/                  [Main source]
├── tests/                [Tests]
├── docs/                 [Documentation]
└── [config files]
```

---

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

1. **Feature Development**: [Feature branches or direct to main]
2. **Testing**: `[pytest, npm test, go test]`
3. **Code Quality**: `[black, prettier, gofmt]`

---

## TESTING STRATEGY

- **Unit Tests**: `tests/unit/` - [count] files
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/` - [count] files
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+

---

## CONSTRAINTS

**TODO**: Define project constraints.

Examples:
- Performance: API responses < 100ms
- Team Size: 1-3 developers
- Technology: Must use Python 3.11+

---

## CURRENT SPRINT

**TODO**: Define current sprint goals.

Example:
- Sprint: Sprint 5 (Nov 1-14, 2025)
- Goal: Implement user authentication
- Tasks: JWT tokens, login/logout, password hashing

---

## QUALITY STANDARDS

- Formatting: [black, prettier]
- Linting: [pylint, eslint]
- Coverage: 80%+ minimum
- Secrets: Environment variables, .env (gitignored)

---

## NOTES

- **Generated**: Auto-generated by autonomous-dev setup wizard
- **Accuracy**: ~90% - Please review TODO sections
- **Validation**: Run `/align-project` to check alignment
```
