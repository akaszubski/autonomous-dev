# Capability Assessment for RLVR

## Detection
1. Compare to baseline on standard benchmarks
2. Check verification task distribution (not over-specialized)
3. Validate no reward gaming

## Prevention
- Small KL (≤0.1)
- Diverse task distribution
- Multi-faceted verification

## Rollback
- Capability drop >5%
- Reward gaming detected
- Verification success without quality

**See**: `../workflow.md` for rollback procedures.
