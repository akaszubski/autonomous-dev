# Stage 7: Evaluation & Monitoring

Validate RLVR model meets quality thresholds.

## Process
1. Run capability benchmarks
2. Evaluate on verification tasks (pass rate)
3. Check capability retention ≥95%
4. Validate no reward gaming
5. Measure false positive/negative rates

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Capability retention ≥95%
- ✅ Verification pass rate improved
- ✅ No reward gaming
- ✅ False positive rate <5%
