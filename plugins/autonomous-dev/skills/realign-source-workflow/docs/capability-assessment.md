# Capability Assessment for Source Attribution

## Detection
1. Compare citation accuracy to baseline
2. Validate attribution coverage improved
3. Check capability benchmarks

## Prevention
- Small KL (≤0.1)
- Balanced citation/general training
- Attribution consistency enforcement

## Rollback
- Capability drop >5%
- Citation accuracy not improving
- Attribution coverage declining

**See**: `../workflow.md` for rollback procedures.
