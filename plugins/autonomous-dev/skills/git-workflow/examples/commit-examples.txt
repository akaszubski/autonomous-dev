## Multi-line Commits with Body

feat: implement distributed caching layer

Add Redis-based distributed caching to reduce database load and improve
response times for frequently accessed data. Cache invalidation is handled
automatically on data updates.

Configuration options:
- REDIS_HOST: Redis server hostname
- REDIS_PORT: Redis server port
- CACHE_TTL: Time-to-live in seconds (default: 3600)

Closes #234

fix: resolve race condition in concurrent file uploads

Use advisory file locking to prevent simultaneous writes to the same file
during parallel upload operations. This resolves data corruption issues
that occurred when multiple workers processed the same file.

The fix implements:
1. File-level locking before write operations
2. Automatic lock release on completion or error
3. Configurable timeout for lock acquisition

Fixes #156, #157, #158

refactor: restructure project directory for better modularity

Reorganize codebase into clear functional modules:
- src/core: Core business logic
- src/api: API endpoints and routing
- src/services: External service integrations
- src/utils: Shared utility functions

This improves code discoverability and enables better separation of
concerns for future development.

Closes #89

## Breaking Changes with Footer

feat(api)!: migrate to REST API v2

BREAKING CHANGE: API endpoints now use /api/v2/ prefix instead of /api/v1/.
All clients must update their base URL configuration.

Migration guide: https://docs.example.com/migration-v2

Closes #45

fix(database)!: correct column type for user_created_at field

BREAKING CHANGE: The user_created_at column type changed from VARCHAR to
TIMESTAMP. Existing databases must run the migration script before upgrading.

Migration script: migrations/003_fix_created_at_column.sql

Fixes #67
