Train model to properly cite sources and attribute claims.

## Overview
Fine-tune model on citation examples to learn source attribution.

## Process
1. Prepare citation training data
2. Fine-tune on attribution patterns
3. Test citation accuracy
4. Validate factuality score ≥90%

## Citation Patterns
- Direct quotes with sources
- Paraphrased claims with attribution
- Uncertainty when no source available

## Quality Gate
- Factuality score ≥90%
- Citation format consistent
- Attribution accurate
