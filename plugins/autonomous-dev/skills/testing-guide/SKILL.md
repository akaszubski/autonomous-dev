## Core Concepts

### 1. Three-Layer Testing Strategy

Modern testing approach combining traditional pytest, GenAI validation, and system performance meta-analysis.

**Layer 1: Traditional Tests (pytest)**
- Unit tests for deterministic logic
- Integration tests for workflows
- Fast, automated, granular feedback

**Layer 2: GenAI Validation (Claude)**
- Validate architectural intent
- Assess code quality beyond syntax
- Comprehensive reasoning about design patterns

**Layer 3: System Performance Testing (Meta-analysis)**
- Agent performance metrics
- Model optimization opportunities
- ROI tracking
- System-wide performance analysis

**See**: `docs/three-layer-strategy.md` for complete framework and decision matrix

---

### 2. Testing Layers

Four-layer testing pyramid from fast unit tests to comprehensive GenAI validation.

**Layers**:
1. **Unit Tests** - Fast, isolated, deterministic (majority of tests)
2. **Integration Tests** - Medium speed, component interactions
3. **UAT Tests** - Slow, end-to-end scenarios (minimal)
4. **GenAI Validation** - Comprehensive, architectural reasoning

**Testing Pyramid**:
```
      /\        Layer 4: GenAI Validation (comprehensive)
     /  \
    /UAT \      Layer 3: UAT Tests (few, slow)
   /______\
  /Int Tests\   Layer 2: Integration Tests (some, medium)
 /__________\
/Unit Tests  \  Layer 1: Unit Tests (many, fast)
```

**See**: `docs/testing-layers.md` for detailed layer descriptions and examples

---

### 3. Testing Workflow & Hybrid Approach

Recommended workflow combining automated testing with manual verification.

**Development Phase**:
- Write failing test first (TDD)
- Implement minimal code to pass
- Refactor with confidence

**Pre-Commit (Automated)**:
- Run fast unit tests
- Check coverage thresholds
- Format code

**Pre-Release (Manual)**:
- GenAI validation for architecture
- Integration tests for workflows
- System performance analysis

**See**: `docs/workflow-hybrid-approach.md` for complete workflow and hybrid testing patterns

---

### 4. TDD Methodology

Test-Driven Development: Write tests before implementation.

**TDD Workflow**:
1. **Red** - Write failing test
2. **Green** - Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green

**Benefits**:
- Guarantees test coverage
- Drives better design
- Provides living documentation
- Enables confident refactoring

**Coverage Standards**:
- Critical paths: 100%
- New features: 80%+
- Bug fixes: Add regression test

**See**: `docs/tdd-methodology.md` for detailed TDD workflow and test patterns

---

### 5. Progression Testing

Track performance improvements over time with baseline comparisons.

**Purpose**:
- Verify optimizations actually improve performance
- Prevent regression in key metrics
- Track system evolution

**How It Works**:
- Establish baseline metrics
- Run progression tests after optimizations
- Compare against baseline
- Update baseline when improvements validated

**See**: `docs/progression-testing.md` for baseline format and test templates

---

### 6. Regression Testing

Prevent fixed bugs from reappearing.

**When to Create**:
- Bug is fixed
- Bug had user impact
- Bug could easily recur

**Regression Test Template**:
```python
def test_regression_issue_123_handles_empty_input():
    """
    Regression test for Issue #123: Handle empty input gracefully.

    Previously crashed with KeyError on empty dict.
    """
    # Arrange
    empty_input = {}

    # Act
    result = process(empty_input)

    # Assert
    assert result == {"status": "empty"}
```

**See**: `docs/regression-testing.md` for complete patterns and organization

---

### 7. Test Organization & Best Practices

Directory structure, naming conventions, and testing best practices.

**Directory Structure**:
```
tests/
├── unit/              # Fast, isolated tests
├── integration/       # Component interaction tests
├── uat/              # End-to-end scenarios
├── progression/      # Performance baselines
└── conftest.py       # Shared fixtures
```

**Naming Conventions**:
- Test files: `test_*.py`
- Test functions: `test_*`
- Fixtures: descriptive names (no `test_` prefix)

**See**: `docs/test-organization-best-practices.md` for detailed conventions and best practices

---

### 8. Pytest Fixtures & Coverage

Common fixtures for setup/teardown and coverage measurement strategies.

**Common Fixtures**:
- `tmp_path` - Temporary directory
- `monkeypatch` - Mock environment variables
- `capsys` - Capture stdout/stderr
- Custom fixtures for project-specific setup

**Coverage Targets**:
- Unit tests: 90%+
- Integration tests: 70%+
- Overall project: 80%+

**Check Coverage**:
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

**See**: `docs/pytest-fixtures-coverage.md` for fixture patterns and coverage strategies

---

### 9. CI/CD Integration

Automated testing in pre-push hooks and GitHub Actions.

**Pre-Push Hook**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
pytest tests/ || exit 1
```

**GitHub Actions**:
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml
```

**See**: `docs/ci-cd-integration.md` for complete CI/CD integration patterns
