# Autonomous Development Installed!

**Plugin**: autonomous-dev v1.0.0
**Installed**: [TIMESTAMP]

## ✨ What's New

Your project now has **fully autonomous development** powered by 8 specialized agents and intelligent automation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Implement any feature autonomously
/auto-implement [feature description]

# Example
/auto-implement user authentication with JWT tokens

# CRITICAL: Clear context after each feature
/clear
```

## 📋 First-Time Setup

### 1. Configure PROJECT.md

```bash
# Edit .claude/PROJECT.md with your project goals
vim .claude/PROJECT.md
```

Update these sections:
- **GOALS**: What you're trying to achieve
- **SCOPE**: What's in/out of scope
- **CONSTRAINTS**: Your technical limits

### 2. Test the System

```bash
/auto-implement simple health check endpoint that returns {"status": "ok"}
```

### 3. Clear Context (Important!)

```bash
/clear
```

This prevents context bloat. **Do this after every feature!**

## 🤖 How It Works

When you run `/auto-implement [feature]`:

```
orchestrator validates against PROJECT.md
    ↓
researcher finds best practices (5 min)
    ↓
planner creates implementation plan (5 min)
    ↓
test-master writes FAILING tests first (5 min)
    ↓
implementer makes tests PASS (10-15 min)
    ↓
reviewer checks code quality (2 min)
    ↓
security-auditor scans for issues (2 min)
    ↓
doc-master updates CHANGELOG (1 min)
    ↓
orchestrator prompts you to /clear
```

**Total**: 20-35 minutes, fully autonomous

## 🧠 8 Agents Installed

- **orchestrator** - Master coordinator, validates alignment
- **researcher** - Web research for best practices
- **planner** - Architecture & design decisions
- **test-master** - TDD test writing (tests first!)
- **implementer** - Code implementation
- **reviewer** - Quality gate checks
- **security-auditor** - Security scanning
- **doc-master** - Documentation sync

## 📚 6 Skills Auto-Load

- **python-standards** - PEP 8, type hints, docstrings
- **testing-guide** - TDD workflow, pytest patterns
- **security-patterns** - OWASP, secrets management
- **documentation-guide** - Docstring format, README
- **research-patterns** - Web search strategies
- **engineering-standards** - Code quality standards

## ⚙️ Automation Hooks

**After you write code** (automatic):
- ✅ Auto-format (black/prettier)
- ✅ Auto-test (pytest/jest)
- ✅ Auto-coverage check (80% minimum)
- ✅ Auto-security scan (secrets/vulnerabilities)

**No manual steps needed!**

## 🔑 Context Management (CRITICAL!)

### Why This Matters

**Without /clear**:
- Context grows to 50K+ tokens after 3-4 features
- System becomes slow and unreliable
- Eventually fails completely

**With /clear**:
- Context stays <1K tokens per feature
- Fast and reliable for 100+ features
- Consistent performance

### After Each Feature

```bash
# 1. Implement feature
/auto-implement [feature]

# 2. Wait for completion (20-35 min)

# 3. CLEAR CONTEXT (mandatory!)
/clear

# 4. Next feature (context is fresh)
```

### Session Files

Agent actions are logged to `docs/sessions/`:

```bash
# View latest session
cat docs/sessions/$(ls -t docs/sessions/ | head -1)
```

Contains: Timestamps, agent names, file paths (not full content)
Result: Context stays minimal

## 📖 PROJECT.md - Staying On Track

**Location**: `.claude/PROJECT.md`

**Purpose**: Define project goals, scope, constraints

**How it works**:
- Orchestrator reads PROJECT.md before each feature
- Validates feature aligns with your goals
- Rejects misaligned features with explanation

**Example rejection**:
```
User: "Add blockchain integration"

orchestrator:
❌ Misaligned with PROJECT.md

Goal: "Build lightweight, fast system"
Requested: Blockchain (heavy, complex)

Suggestion: Focus on core features or update PROJECT.md if strategy changed
```

**Update PROJECT.md**: Review monthly or when direction changes

## 💡 Examples

### Simple Feature
```bash
/auto-implement health check endpoint returning {"status": "ok"}
```

### Medium Complexity
```bash
/auto-implement user authentication with:
- JWT tokens with refresh tokens
- Bcrypt password hashing
- HTTP-only cookies
- Rate limiting (5 req/min on login)
```

### Complex Feature
```bash
/auto-implement REST API for blog posts with:
- CRUD operations
- Pagination (20 per page)
- Full-text search by title/content
- Tag filtering
- Author association
- Published/draft status
- 80%+ test coverage
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Context budget exceeded"
```bash
/clear  # Then retry
```

### "Feature doesn't align with PROJECT.md"
```bash
# Check goals
cat .claude/PROJECT.md | grep -A 5 "## GOALS"

# Either:
# 1. Modify feature to align
# 2. Update PROJECT.md if strategy changed
```

### "Tests failing"
```bash
# See details
cat docs/sessions/$(ls -t docs/sessions/ | head -1)
```

### "Hooks not running"
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/hooks/*.py

# Install dependencies
pip install black isort pytest pytest-cov
```

## 📊 What You Get
