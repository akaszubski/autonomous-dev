  "displayName": "Autonomous Development (PROJECT.md-First)",
  "version": "3.8.0",
  "description": "PROJECT.md-first autonomous development with 20 specialized agents, 27 skills, and 42 automation hooks. Full SDLC automation via /auto-implement command. Zero scope creep with automatic PROJECT.md validation. Works for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go projects.",
  "longDescription": "Transform your development workflow with autonomous agents that handle the full SDLC automatically.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Validates every feature against PROJECT.md goals BEFORE work begins (zero scope creep)\n- Researches best practices automatically\n- Plans architecture and integration points\n- Writes tests first (TDD)\n- Implements code to pass tests\n- Reviews code quality\n- Scans for security vulnerabilities\n- Updates documentation automatically\n\n**20 Specialized Agents:**\nCore Workflow (9): researcher, planner, test-master, implementer, reviewer, security-auditor, doc-master, advisor, quality-validator\n\nUtility (11): alignment-validator, commit-message-generator, pr-description-generator, issue-creator, brownfield-analyzer, project-progress-tracker, alignment-analyzer, project-bootstrapper, setup-wizard, project-status-analyzer, sync-validator\n\nNote: orchestrator removed in v3.2.2 - Claude coordinates directly\n\n**20 Commands:**\n- Core Workflow (11): /auto-implement, /batch-implement, /align-project, /align-claude, /align-project-retrofit, /setup, /sync, /status, /health-check, /pipeline-status, /update-plugin\n- Individual Agents (8): /research, /plan, /test-feature, /implement, /review, /security-scan, /update-docs, /create-issue\n- Utility (1): /test\n\n**27 Skills (Progressive Disclosure):**\nCore Development (7): api-design, architecture-patterns, code-review, database-design, testing-guide, security-patterns, error-handling-patterns\n\nWorkflow & Automation (7): git-workflow, github-workflow, project-management, documentation-guide, agent-output-formats, skill-integration, skill-integration-templates\n\nCode & Quality (4): python-standards, observability, consistency-enforcement, file-organization\n\nValidation & Analysis (6): research-patterns, semantic-validation, cross-reference-validation, documentation-currency, advisor-triggers, project-alignment-validation\n\nLibrary Design (3): library-design-patterns, state-management-patterns, api-integration-patterns\n\n**42 Automation Hooks:**\nCore (11): auto_format, auto_test, security_scan, validate_project_alignment, validate_claude_alignment, enforce_file_organization, enforce_pipeline_complete, enforce_tdd, detect_feature_request, auto_git_workflow, auto_approve_tool\n\nOptional (20+): Coverage enforcement, documentation sync, issue tracking, and more\n\n**21 Reusable Libraries:**\nCore utilities for security, validation, automation, and brownfield retrofit\n\n**Key Features:**\n- PROJECT.md-first: Every feature validates against strategic goals\n- Batch processing: /batch-implement handles 50+ features sequentially\n- Crash recovery: State-based resume for interrupted workflows\n- GitHub integration: Auto-create issues with research\n- Parallel validation: 60% faster quality checks\n- Context management: Scale to 100+ features without bloat\n\n**Result:** Focus on features, everything else is automatic.",
