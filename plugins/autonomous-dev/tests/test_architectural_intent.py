"""
Architectural Intent Validation Tests (LAYER 2: Static Validation)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are STATIC tests. They validate structure and keywords,
but cannot validate BEHAVIOR or INTENT.

For comprehensive architectural validation, use:
    /validate-architecture (GenAI-powered, understands MEANING)

These tests validate the DESIGN INTENT and ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS
documented in ARCHITECTURE.md through static analysis.

LIMITATIONS:
- Can only check if files exist and contain keywords
- Cannot understand if implementation matches INTENT
- Cannot detect subtle behavioral drift
- Example: Can check "PROJECT.md" appears in orchestrator.md,
  but can't verify orchestrator actually validates alignment

USE CASES:
- CI/CD pipeline (fast, automated)
- Pre-commit checks (quick sanity)
- Catch obvious regressions (file removal, count changes)

If these tests fail, it means:
1. The architecture has fundamentally changed (update ARCHITECTURE.md), OR
2. A regression has occurred (fix the code), OR
3. The test is too strict (update the test)

Each test documents WHY an architectural decision was made and validates
structural invariants remain true.

See ARCHITECTURE.md § Testing This Document for full validation strategy.
