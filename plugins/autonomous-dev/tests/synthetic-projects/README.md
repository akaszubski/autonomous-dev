# Autonomous-Dev v3.0.0 Synthetic Test Projects

**Purpose**: Validate all 6 implemented enhancements with realistic test scenarios

**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Version**: 3.0.0

---

## Overview

These synthetic projects test autonomous-dev v3.0.0 features in isolation. Each project focuses on specific enhancements and contains intentionally planted issues.

---

## Test Projects

### Test Project 1: Simple API (Missing PROJECT.md)

**Location**: `test1-simple-api/`
**Tests**: Enhancement 3 - PROJECT.md Bootstrapping
**Planted Issues**:
- Missing PROJECT.md

## Manual Testing Workflow

For comprehensive validation:

### Phase 1: PROJECT.md Bootstrapping

```bash
cd test1-simple-api

# Test generate mode
/create-project-md --generate
cat PROJECT.md | wc -l  # Should be 300-500 lines
grep "Architecture Pattern" PROJECT.md  # Should detect MVC

# Test template mode
rm PROJECT.md
/create-project-md --template
grep "TODO" PROJECT.md  # Should have TODO markers

# Test interactive mode
rm PROJECT.md
/create-project-md --interactive
# Answer wizard questions
# Review generated PROJECT.md
```

### Phase 2: Semantic Validation

```bash
cd test2-translation-service

# Run full alignment
/align-project

# Verify Phase 2 output
# - Should detect "Stream Handling (CRITICAL)" is SOLVED
# - Should find version mismatch (3 files)

# Verify Phase 3 output
# - Should detect stale "WIP" marker
# - Should find 2 "coming soon" features implemented

# Check alignment score
# Expected: 50-70% (intentionally broken project)
```

### Phase 3: File Organization

```bash
cd test3-messy-project

# List misplaced files
ls -la *.sh *.md *.ts
# Should see 8 files in wrong locations

# Run alignment
/align-project

# Choose Option 2 (interactive fix)
# Approve Phase A

# Verify files moved
ls -la scripts/test/  # Should have test-auth.sh
ls -la scripts/debug/  # Should have debug-local.sh
ls -la docs/guides/  # Should have user-guide.md
ls -la src/  # Should have helper.ts, utils.ts

# Verify root clean
ls -la *.md | wc -l  # Should be ≤ 8
```

### Phase 4: Cross-Reference Updates

```bash
cd test4-broken-refs

# Run alignment
/align-project

# Check Phase 4 output
# - Should detect 4 file path references to debug-local.sh
# - Should detect 1 broken markdown link
# - Should detect 1 invalid line reference

# Test hook directly
python ../../../hooks/post_file_move.py "debug-local.sh" "scripts/debug/debug-local.sh"
# Should find and offer to update 4 references

# Verify updates
grep "scripts/debug/debug-local.sh" README.md docs/**/*.md
# All references should be updated
```

## Common Issues

### "Skills not found"

**Problem**: Skills not loaded
**Solution**: Ensure v3.0.0 installed, restart Claude Code

### "Agent can't invoke skills"

**Problem**: Skill tool not available to agent
**Solution**: Check agent frontmatter has `tools: [Skill]`

### "Git history required"

**Problem**: Some tests need git for age detection
**Solution**: Run `git init && git add . && git commit -m "test"` in project

### "Pre-commit hook not running"

**Problem**: Hooks not installed
**Solution**: Run `/setup` in test project

---

## Cleanup

After testing:

```bash
# Reset all test projects
./cleanup-all.sh

# Or manually
cd test1-simple-api && rm -f PROJECT.md
cd test2-translation-service && git checkout .
cd test3-messy-project && git checkout .
cd test4-broken-refs && git checkout .
```

## Adding New Tests

To add a test project:

1. Create directory: `test5-my-test/`
2. Add test scenario files
3. Create `VALIDATION.md` with:
   - Purpose and what it tests
   - Planted issues list
   - Expected behavior
   - Validation checklist
4. Update `run-all-tests.sh`
5. Document in this README
