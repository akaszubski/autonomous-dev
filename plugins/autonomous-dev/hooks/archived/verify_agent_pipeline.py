Pipeline Verification Hook - Verify Agent Execution

This PreCommit hook verifies that the expected agents ran for feature implementations.

Hook Type: PreCommit (OPTIONAL - can be enabled for stricter enforcement)
Trigger: Before git commit completes

Purpose:
    - Detect if full SDLC pipeline was skipped
    - Warn about missing agents (researcher, test-master, etc.)
    - Ensure autonomous workflow was used for feature work

Behavior:
    - If today's pipeline file doesn't exist → PASS (not a feature commit)
    - If file exists but agents missing → WARN (shows what's missing)
    - If all expected agents ran → PASS (full pipeline executed)

Expected agents for feature implementations:
    - researcher (always)
    - planner (architecture/medium+ features)
    - test-master (TDD required)
    - implementer (always)
    - reviewer (quality gate)
    - security-auditor (security-sensitive features)
    - doc-master (always)

Configuration (add to .claude/settings.local.json):
    {
      "hooks": {
        "PreCommit": [{
          "hooks": [{
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python .claude/hooks/verify_agent_pipeline.py || exit 1"
          }]
        }]
      }
    }

Exit codes:
    0 - All checks passed
    1 - Missing agents detected (if strict mode enabled)

Note: By default, this hook WARNS but doesn't block. Set STRICT_PIPELINE=1
      environment variable to block commits when agents are missing.
