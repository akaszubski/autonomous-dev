PROJECT.md Alignment Validation Hook - Gatekeeper for STRICT MODE

This hook enforces that PROJECT.md exists and all work aligns with it.
It's a BLOCKING hook that prevents commits if alignment fails.

What it checks:
- PROJECT.md exists
- PROJECT.md has required sections (GOALS, SCOPE, CONSTRAINTS)
- Current changes align with PROJECT.md SCOPE
- Documentation mentions PROJECT.md

This is the GATEKEEPER for strict mode - nothing proceeds without alignment.

Usage:
    Add to .claude/settings.local.json PreCommit hooks:
    {
      "hooks": {
        "PreCommit": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python .claude/hooks/validate_project_alignment.py || exit 1"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Exit codes:
- 0: PROJECT.md aligned
- 1: PROJECT.md missing or misaligned (blocks commit)
