"""
Pre-commit hook: Enforce pipeline completeness for /auto-implement features

This hook ensures that features developed with /auto-implement go through
the full 7-agent pipeline before being committed.

Pipeline agents:
1. researcher
2. planner
3. test-master
4. implementer
5. reviewer
6. security-auditor
7. doc-master

If pipeline is incomplete, the commit is blocked with instructions on how to fix.
