## Resume Instructions

3. Review recent files and workflow state
4. Continue with pending tasks or ask what's next

## How This Works

This file is auto-generated and maintained by Claude to track active work.
It provides a human-readable summary of the current session state.

**Files:**
- `SESSION_STATE.json` - Machine-readable state (primary source)
- `ACTIVE_WORK.md` - Human-readable summary (this file)
- `OPERATIONS.md` - Repo-specific procedures (never auto-modified)

**Protected during `/sync`:** All files in `.claude/local/` are preserved across sync operations (Issue #244).
