Issue #79 - Tracking Infrastructure Path Resolution - Test Files

TEST FILES CREATED (5 modules, 82 tests):

1. tests/unit/test_tracking_path_resolution.py
   - 24 tests covering PROJECT_ROOT detection and path resolution
   - Tests session_tracker.py, agent_tracker.py, batch_state_manager.py
   - Verifies all paths resolve from PROJECT_ROOT, not cwd
   - Tests subdirectory execution (plugins/, scripts/, hooks/)

2. tests/unit/test_tracking_cross_platform.py
   - 14 tests covering Windows, Linux, macOS path handling
   - Tests path separators (backslash vs forward slash)
   - Tests case sensitivity (Linux) vs case-insensitive (macOS)
   - Tests Unicode paths, symlinks, and very long paths

3. tests/unit/test_tracking_directory_creation.py
   - 15 tests covering automatic directory creation
   - Tests docs/sessions/ auto-creation
   - Tests .claude/ auto-creation
   - Tests idempotent mkdir, permissions, race conditions

4. tests/unit/test_tracking_security.py
   - 19 tests covering security validation
   - Tests path traversal prevention (../../etc/passwd)
   - Tests input validation (agent names, messages, issue numbers)
   - Tests symlink attack prevention
   - Tests file permissions (world-writable checks)

5. tests/integration/test_tracking_integration.py
   - 10 tests covering end-to-end integration
   - Tests SessionTracker + AgentTracker coordination
   - Tests BatchState persistence across sessions
   - Tests hook execution context (imports from hooks/)
   - Tests concurrent access, real-world workflows

VERIFICATION DOCUMENT:

tests/ISSUE79_TDD_RED_VERIFICATION.md
   - Comprehensive test summary
   - Expected failure breakdown (~50 failures expected)
   - Implementation guidance
   - Next steps for green phase

RUN COMMANDS:

# Run all Issue #79 tests
venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_tracking_*.py tests/integration/test_tracking_integration.py -v

# Run specific test module
venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_tracking_path_resolution.py -v

# Run with coverage
venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_tracking_*.py --cov=plugins/autonomous_dev/lib --cov=scripts

EXPECTED RESULTS (TDD Red Phase):

- Path resolution tests: FAIL (hardcoded paths not fixed yet)
- Security tests: FAIL (validation not implemented yet)
- Integration tests: FAIL (depend on path resolution)
- Cross-platform tests: MOSTLY PASS (pathlib handles it)
- Directory creation tests: MOSTLY PASS (mkdir has exist_ok=True)

Total: ~50 failures, ~32 passes (until implementation complete)

FILES AFFECTED BY IMPLEMENTATION:

1. plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/session_tracker.py (line 25)
2. scripts/session_tracker.py (line 20)
3. scripts/agent_tracker.py (line 179)
4. plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/batch_state_manager.py (DEFAULT_STATE_FILE)
5. Multiple hooks with hardcoded session paths

NEW FILES TO CREATE:

1. plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/path_utils.py (find_project_root function)
2. plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/validation.py (path and input validation)
