feat(lib): Add AI-powered merge conflict resolution (#183)

Implement conflict_resolver.py with three-tier resolution strategy:
- Tier 1: Auto-merge for trivial conflicts (whitespace, identical)
- Tier 2: Claude API for semantic conflict analysis (3-5 sec)
- Tier 3: Full-file context for complex merges (5-15 sec)

Key features:
- ConflictBlock, ResolutionSuggestion, ConflictResolutionResult dataclasses
- parse_conflict_markers() with diff3 format support
- Exponential backoff retry for API failures
- Atomic file writes with backup
- Security: CWE-22, CWE-59, CWE-117 protection

28 tests (100% pass rate), integrated with /worktree --merge.
Smoke tests: 298/298 passing
