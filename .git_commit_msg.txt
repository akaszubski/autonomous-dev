test(lib): Add tests for worktree manager (#178)

Add 73 tests for git worktree isolation feature:
- 40 passing (validation, dataclasses, parsing)
- 33 pending (complex mock setup needs refinement)

The worktree_manager.py (827 lines) and worktree_command.py (506 lines)
were already implemented in a previous session. This adds test coverage.

Key features tested:
- Feature name validation (path traversal, injection prevention)
- WorktreeInfo and MergeResult dataclasses
- Command argument parsing
- Security controls (CWE-22, CWE-78, CWE-59)

Smoke tests: 298/298 passing
