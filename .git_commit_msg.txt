feat(pipeline): Add automatic complexity assessment for pipeline scaling (#181)

Implements intelligent pipeline optimization based on feature complexity:

- New library: complexity_assessor.py (441 lines) with ComplexityAssessor class
- Complexity levels: SIMPLE (3 agents), STANDARD (6 agents), COMPLEX (8 agents)
- Keyword heuristics: typo/docs → SIMPLE, auth/security → COMPLEX
- Confidence scoring: 0.0-1.0 with multi-factor analysis
- Security-first: COMPLEX keywords override SIMPLE signals
- CLI wrapper: scripts/complexity_assessor.py with JSON/text output

Agent Distribution:
- SIMPLE: researcher-local, implementer, reviewer (~8 min)
- STANDARD: + planner, test-master, doc-master (~15 min)
- COMPLEX: + security-auditor, researcher-web (~25 min)

Performance Impact:
- 67% faster for simple changes (typos, docs)
- 40% faster for standard features
- Full pipeline for security-sensitive work

Test coverage:
- 52 unit tests (tests/unit/lib/test_complexity_assessor.py)
- All edge cases covered (empty, conflicting, long input)

Files added:
- plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/complexity_assessor.py
- plugins/autonomous-dev/scripts/complexity_assessor.py
- tests/unit/lib/test_complexity_assessor.py

Files updated:
- CLAUDE.md (workflow section)
- docs/LIBRARIES.md (Section 63)
- plugins/autonomous-dev/config/install_manifest.json

Cleanup:
- Removed stray test files from lib/ directory

Closes #181
