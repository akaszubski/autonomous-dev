feat(hooks): Register Stop hook for end-of-turn quality gates (#177)

The stop_quality_gate.py hook was already implemented but not registered
in settings templates. This commit adds:

- Stop hook registration to settings.default.json
- Stop hook registration to settings.autonomous-dev.json
- 60-second timeout for quality checks (pytest, ruff, mypy)

Hook features:
- Runs quality checks after every turn
- Non-blocking (always exits EXIT_SUCCESS)
- Configurable via ENFORCE_QUALITY_GATE env var
- Detects available tools (pytest.ini, ruff.toml, mypy.ini)

Tests: 57 passing in test_stop_quality_gate.py
Smoke tests: 298/298 passing
