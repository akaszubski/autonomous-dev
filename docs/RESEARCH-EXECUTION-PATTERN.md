# Research → Execution Pattern: Creating Enduring Knowledge

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Purpose**: Establish repeatable system for managing research, converting to patterns, and executing consistently
**Status**: Framework Definition

---

## The Problem We're Solving

Current state:
- ✅ We have research (SKILLS-AGENTS-INTEGRATION.md)
- ✅ We have issue (#18 with implementation plan)
- ❌ But no clear connection between them
- ❌ No enduring pattern for future research → execution cycles
- ❌ Risk of knowledge loss or inconsistent execution

Goal: Create a **living system** that:
1. Captures research durably
2. Converts research → actionable patterns
3. Links patterns to implementation issues
4. Ensures consistent execution
5. Builds organizational knowledge over time

## Part 5: Execution Consistency Framework

### The Execution Checklist Template

**For Each Issue Implementation** (like #18):

Create: `docs/execution/2025-10-27-agent-skill-integration-execution.md`

```markdown
# Execution Log: Agent-Skill Integration (#18)

**Issue**: #18
**Pattern**: docs/patterns/agent-skill-integration-pattern.md
**Researcher**: Claude Code
**Implementer**: [TBD]
**Start Date**: 2025-10-27
**Estimated Completion**: 2025-11-10

## Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Read research doc completely
- [ ] Review pattern specification
- [ ] Understand success criteria
- [ ] Identify dependencies
- [ ] Plan resource allocation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Skill Metadata Optimization
**Assigned To**: [Name]
**Target Date**: 2025-10-30
**Success Criteria**: All 18 skills have trigger-specific descriptions

- [ ] Audit python-standards skill
- [ ] Audit security-patterns skill
- [ ] Audit testing-guide skill
- [ ] Audit api-design skill
- [ ] ... (all 18)

## Part 6: Knowledge Base Evolution

### The Feedback Loop

**After Implementation Completes** (Issue is closed):

1. **Extract Learnings** from execution log
2. **Update Pattern** with what actually worked
3. **Update Research** with new findings
4. **Create Checklist** for future similar work

### Example: Skills-Agents Implementation Feedback

After Issue #18 is complete:

**Update Pattern**:
```markdown
# Pattern: Agent-Skill Integration (Updated)

## What We Learned
### What Worked Well ✅
- Progressive disclosure pattern was adopted smoothly
- Agents recognized skill metadata without modification
- Context overhead minimal (2-5KB as predicted)

### What We'd Do Differently Next Time
- Start with pilot agents (3) instead of all 19
- Metadata descriptions need real-world testing
- Progressive disclosure requires user guidance

### Metrics
- Actual time: 12 hours (estimated: 16 hours)
- Success rate: 95% (18/19 agents)
- Adoption rate: [Measurement]

## Evolved Checklist for Future Agent-Skill Integration
[Refined steps based on actual execution]
```

**Create New Pattern** (if applicable):
- Pattern: "Skill Metadata Discovery Optimization"
- Pattern: "Agent Prompt Skill Integration Template"

---

## Part 7: Governance & Consistency

### How to Ensure Consistent Execution

#### Rule 1: Research Drives Issues
```
Research → Pattern → Issue (Never Issue without Research & Pattern)
```

**Before creating GitHub issue**:
- ✅ Complete research doc
- ✅ Create/review pattern doc
- ✅ Link both in issue description
- ❌ Don't create issue without research backing

#### Rule 2: Pattern Must Have Implementation Checklist
Every pattern must include:
- Clear steps
- Success criteria
- When to use/not use
- Examples

#### Rule 3: Execution Must Reference Pattern
Every implementation must:
- Link to pattern in PR description
- Reference pattern checklist
- Track adherence to pattern
- Report deviations

#### Rule 4: Close the Loop
After implementation:
- Update pattern with lessons
- Update research with new findings
- Create follow-up patterns if discovered
- Archive execution log

#### Rule 5: Keep Index Current
Maintain:
- `docs/research/INDEX.md`
- `docs/patterns/INDEX.md`
- Pattern status (Proven, Beta, Deprecated)

### What to Rename/Move

**Immediate**:
1. Move `docs/SKILLS-AGENTS-INTEGRATION.md` → `docs/research/2025-10-27-claude-code-skills-agents.md`
2. Create `docs/patterns/agent-skill-integration-pattern.md` (extract from research)
3. Create `docs/research/INDEX.md`
4. Create `docs/patterns/INDEX.md`
5. Create `docs/RESEARCH-EXECUTION-PATTERN.md` (this framework)

## Part 9: Implementing This System Immediately

### For Issue #18 (Agent-Skill Integration):

**Step 1: Create Pattern Document**
```bash
# Extract pattern from your research
# File: docs/patterns/agent-skill-integration-pattern.md
```

**Step 2: Create Execution Log**
```bash
# File: docs/execution/2025-10-27-agent-skill-integration-execution.md
# Ready to fill in as implementation proceeds
```

**Step 3: Create Indices**
```bash
# File: docs/research/INDEX.md
# File: docs/patterns/INDEX.md
```

**Step 4: Update Issue #18**
Add to issue description:
```markdown
## Documentation Links
🔬 **Research**: docs/research/2025-10-27-claude-code-skills-agents.md
🎯 **Pattern**: docs/patterns/agent-skill-integration-pattern.md
📊 **Execution**: docs/execution/2025-10-27-agent-skill-integration-execution.md
```

**Step 5: Use Pattern as Implementation Guide**
When building Phase 1, 2, 3, 4:
- Reference pattern checklist
- Update execution log daily
- Capture learnings
- Track deviations

---

## Part 10: Consistency Rules (TL;DR)

**Always Follow This Flow**:

```
1. RESEARCH
   └─ Save to docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md
      └─ Update docs/research/INDEX.md

2. EXTRACT PATTERN
   └─ Create docs/patterns/pattern-name.md
      └─ Update docs/patterns/INDEX.md

3. CREATE ISSUE
   └─ Link to research & pattern in description
      └─ Add implementation checklist

4. IMPLEMENT
   └─ Follow pattern checklist
   └─ Log daily in execution doc
   └─ Track adherence to pattern

5. VALIDATE
   └─ Close issue
   └─ Update pattern with lessons
   └─ Archive execution log
   └─ Create follow-up patterns if needed

6. IMPROVE
   └─ Update research with findings
   └─ Evolve pattern based on real-world use
   └─ Build organizational knowledge
```

**The system ensures**:
- ✅ Research isn't lost
- ✅ Patterns are proven before use
- ✅ Issues are well-planned
- ✅ Execution is consistent
- ✅ Knowledge accumulates
- ✅ Future work builds on past learnings

---

## Summary

You now have a **three-tier documentation system**:

1. **Research** (Exploratory) - Raw findings from web/analysis
2. **Patterns** (Formalized) - Proven approaches with checklists
3. **Execution** (Operational) - Implementation logs and tracking

This creates **enduring knowledge** that:
- Persists across developers
- Reduces context switching
- Ensures consistency
- Builds organizational memory
- Prevents knowledge loss

For #18 specifically:
- ✅ Research exists: SKILLS-AGENTS-INTEGRATION.md
- 🔄 Need to create: Pattern doc + Execution log
- ✅ Issue exists: #18 with checklist
- ⏳ Ready to implement when you start
