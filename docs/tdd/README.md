# TDD Documentation Archive

This directory contains TDD documentation, implementation guides, and test summaries from feature development.

## Purpose

- **Historical record**: Track TDD approach for past features
- **Learning resource**: Examples of test-first development
- **Reference**: Implementation patterns and test strategies

## Contents

- `*_TDD_*.md` - TDD red phase summaries and verification
- `*_IMPLEMENTER_GUIDE.md` - Implementation guides for features
- `*_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference guides
- `*_TEST_*.md` - Test summaries and architecture
- `ISSUE*.md` - Issue-specific TDD documentation
- `PHASE*.md` - Phase-based development summaries
- `*.txt` - Test file lists and structures

## Lifecycle

These files are **working artifacts** created during feature development:
1. Created during TDD red phase
2. Updated during implementation
3. Archived here after feature completion
4. Gitignored to prevent repository bloat
