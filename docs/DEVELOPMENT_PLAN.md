# Development Plan - Autonomous Dev Plugin

**Version**: v3.2.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-03
**Status**: Active Development

> **Note**: This is a high-level plan. Detailed tasks are tracked in GitHub issues.

## Project Mission

Build an autonomous development team (not a toolkit) that executes on PROJECT.md goals using best practices, automated SDLC, and AI intelligence.

**Core Philosophy**: "Less is more" - Use all elements to make dev life simple and automated, but only build what's necessary.

---

## Current Focus

**Epic**: [Complete end-to-end autonomous workflow implementation](https://github.com/akaszubski/autonomous-dev/issues/41)

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED ✅)

**Goal**: Make autonomous workflow actually work and be visible

**Key Issues**:
- ✅ #37 - Enable auto-orchestration (COMPLETED 2025-11-03)
- ✅ #38 - Update global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (COMPLETED 2025-11-03)
- ✅ #29 - Add agent pipeline execution verification and logging (COMPLETED 2025-11-03)
- ✅ #32 - Enhance orchestrator agent prompt to more reliably invoke specialist agents (COMPLETED 2025-11-03)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Feature detection triggers automatically
- ✅ Agents invoke reliably (enhanced orchestrator with explicit directives)
- ✅ Session logs show what happened (structured JSON pipeline logs)
- ✅ User can see workflow execution (/pipeline-status command)

**Status**: 4/4 complete (100%) ✅

---

## Phase 2: Automation (Planned)

**Goal**: Complete "zero manual git operations" success criteria

**Key Issues**:
- [ ] #40 - Auto-update PROJECT.md goal progress after feature completion
- [ ] #39 - Implement automatic git operations (commit, push, PR creation)
- [ ] #34 - Enhance hook-triggered orchestration with pattern-based detection
- [ ] #26 - Configure branch protection rules for master and develop

**Success Criteria**:
- User says "implement X" → PR created automatically
- PROJECT.md progress updates automatically
- No manual git commands needed
- Quality gates enforced via hooks

**Status**: 0/4 complete (0%)

---

## Phase 3: Polish (Future)

**Goal**: Professional release process and documentation

**Key Issues**:
- [ ] #27 - Create milestone-based release workflow documentation
- [ ] #25 - Implement automated semantic versioning with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Reassess #42, #28, #24 based on real usage

**Success Criteria**:
- Releases automated via GitHub Actions
- Documentation always in sync
- Version bumping automated
- Professional release notes

**Status**: 0/3 complete (0%)

## Backlog / Validate Need

**Issues requiring validation before implementation**:
- ⏸️ #42 - Add real-time progress indicators (validate session logs insufficient first)
- ⏸️ #28 - Integrate GenAI-powered semantic testing (validate current hooks insufficient first)
- ⏸️ #24 - Implement develop branch (validate solo dev needs it first)
- ⏸️ #43 - Create /sync-dev command (redesign: integrate into /health-check or close)

**Validation process**: Use feature for 3-5 real scenarios, prove need, then implement.

## Design Decisions

**For detailed design decisions, see**:
- `docs/ANTI-BLOAT-PHILOSOPHY.md` - Why "less is more" is a design requirement
- `docs/BLOAT-DETECTION-CHECKLIST.md` - 4 gates every feature must pass
- `docs/ISSUE-ALIGNMENT-ANALYSIS.md` - How current issues align with mission
- `.claude/PROJECT.md` - Strategic direction (GOALS, SCOPE, CONSTRAINTS)

## Metrics & Progress

**Overall Progress**: Phase 1 active (25% complete)

**Success Metrics (from PROJECT.md)**:
- ✅ Quality enforcement: 100% (hooks always fire)
- ⏳ Autonomous execution: 25% (detection works, agents need reliability improvement)
- ⏳ Zero manual git: 0% (planned for Phase 2)
- ⏳ Speed via AI: 50% (some steps accelerated, not all)

**Command count**: 7/8 used (1 slot available)
**Agent count**: 19 active
**Hook count**: 28 active

## How This Plan Works (Hybrid Approach)

**High-level plan** (this file):
- Overview of phases
- Success criteria per phase
- Links to GitHub issues for details
- Progress tracking

**Detailed tasks** (GitHub issues):
- Specific implementation details
- Comments and discussion
- Status updates
- Assignees and labels

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Plan in repo (survives GitHub changes)
- ✅ GitHub native features (projects, milestones, automation)
- ✅ Single source of truth (issues)
- ✅ No custom sync needed

**Update frequency**:
- Issues: Updated continuously as work progresses
- This plan: Updated weekly or when phases change
