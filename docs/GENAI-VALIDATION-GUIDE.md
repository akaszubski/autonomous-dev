# GenAI Quality Validation - Complete Guide

**Version**: 2.3.1
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25
**Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

---

## Overview

The autonomous-dev plugin includes a comprehensive GenAI-powered quality validation system that uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 for maximum accuracy. All validation capabilities are unified in a single tool: `genai_validate.py`.

### Why GenAI vs Regex?

- **Semantic Understanding**: Understands context, not just keywords
- **99%+ Accuracy**: vs 60-70% with regex pattern matching
- **Context-Aware**: Distinguishes plugin versions from external packages
- **Self-Explaining**: Provides reasoning for all decisions
- **No False Positives**: Understands "anthropic 3.3.0" is NOT a plugin version

### Cost on Max Plan

**$0/month** - Unlimited usage on Anthropic Max Plan

---

## Installation

```bash
# Required packages
pip install anthropic  # For Anthropic API
# OR
pip install openai     # For OpenRouter API

# Set API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# OR
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Validate PROJECT.md alignment
python plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/genai_validate.py alignment --feature "Add OAuth"

# Validate documentation consistency
python plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/genai_validate.py docs --full

# Code review
python plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/genai_validate.py code-review --diff

# Security scan
python plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/genai_validate.py security --file src/api.py

# Version consistency
python plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/genai_validate.py version-sync --check
```

---

## All Validators

### 1. PROJECT.md Alignment

**Purpose**: Validates features align with strategic goals, scope, and constraints

**Use Cases**:
- Before implementing new features
- During code review
- Strategic planning validation

**Usage**:
```bash
# Validate feature description
python lib/genai_validate.py alignment --feature "Add team collaboration"

# Validate current git diff
python lib/genai_validate.py alignment --diff
```

**Example Output**:
```
‚ùå MISALIGNED (3/10)

Reasoning: Feature violates solo developer scope constraint. PROJECT.md explicitly
scopes this plugin for individual developers, not teams.

Scope Violations:
  ‚ùå Team features marked as experimental/future only
  ‚ùå Current sprint focused on documentation accuracy, not new features

Suggestions:
  üí° Focus on solo developer productivity features instead
  üí° Defer team collaboration to future roadmap
```

**Exit Codes**:
- 0 = Aligned (score ‚â•7, no violations)
- 1 = Misaligned

---

### 2. Documentation Consistency

**Purpose**: Prevents overpromising - ensures docs match code reality

**Use Cases**:
- Before releases
- After updating documentation
- When adding new features

**Usage**:
```bash
# Validate all documentation
python lib/genai_validate.py docs --full

# Validate specific file
python lib/genai_validate.py docs --file README.md
```

**Example Output**:
```
‚ùå INCONSISTENCIES FOUND - README.md

[CRITICAL] Claim: "Automatically syncs version references"
           Reality: Code only syncs Python docstrings, not versions
           Reason: auto_update_docs.py has no version checking logic

[HIGH] Claim: "6 core skills"
       Reality: Actually 13 skills exist
       Reason: Count mismatch in filesystem vs documentation
```

**What It Catches**:
1. Overpromising (claims features that don't exist)
2. Count mismatches (wrong numbers)
3. Misleading descriptions
4. Outdated behavior
5. Missing caveats

**Exit Codes**:
- 0 = Consistent
- 1 = Inconsistencies found

---

### 3. Code Review Quality Gate

**Purpose**: Deep code review with architectural awareness

**Use Cases**:
- Before committing
- During pull request review
- Pre-release validation

**Usage**:
```bash
# Review git diff
python lib/genai_validate.py code-review --diff
```

**Example Output**:
```
‚ùå REJECTED - Score: 4/10

Issues:
  [critical] SQL injection risk: User input concatenated into query (line 42)
  [high] No null check before dereference (line 58)
  [medium] Variable name 'x' not semantic

Suggestions:
  - Use parameterized queries
  - Add null validation
  - Rename 'x' to 'user_count'
```

**Review Checklist**:
1. Logic & Correctness (edge cases, race conditions)
2. Code Quality (naming, complexity, DRY)
3. Architecture (patterns, modularity, coupling)
4. Security (input validation, injection risks)
5. Testing (tests included, edge cases covered)
6. Performance (algorithm complexity, leaks)

**Exit Codes**:
- 0 = Approved (score ‚â•7)
- 1 = Rejected

---

### 4. Test Quality Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluates test quality beyond coverage %

**Use Cases**:
- After writing tests
- During code review
- Before release

**Usage**:
```bash
python lib/genai_validate.py test-quality \
  --test-file tests/test_auth.py \
  --source-file src/auth.py
```

**Example Output**:
```
Test Quality Score: 4/10
Coverage Meaningful: ‚ùå

Gaps:
  - Missing edge case: null input
  - No error condition tests (invalid credentials)
  - Tests share state (not independent)

Recommendations:
  - Add boundary value tests
  - Test exception paths
  - Use test fixtures for isolation
```

**Assessment Criteria**:
1. Edge cases (null, empty, boundary values)
2. Error conditions (exceptions, invalid input)
3. Test independence (no shared state)
4. Meaningful assertions
5. Descriptive test names
6. Proper setup/teardown
7. Appropriate mocking

**Exit Codes**:
- 0 = Good tests (score ‚â•7)
- 1 = Poor quality

---

### 5. Security Vulnerability Detection

**Purpose**: Context-aware security scanning

**Use Cases**:
- Before committing sensitive code
- During security audits
- Pre-release validation

**Usage**:
```bash
python lib/genai_validate.py security --file src/api.py
```

**Example Output**:
```
‚ùå VULNERABILITIES FOUND - Risk: 8/10

[critical] SQL Injection: User input in query string (line 156)
           Fix: Use parameterized queries with placeholders

[high] Sensitive data in logs: API keys logged in error handler (line 203)
       Fix: Redact sensitive fields before logging

[medium] Weak crypto: Using MD5 for password hashing (line 89)
         Fix: Use bcrypt or Argon2
```

**Security Checks**:
1. Injection attacks (SQL, command, LDAP, XML)
2. XSS vulnerabilities
3. Authentication/authorization bypasses
4. Data exposure (logs, PII, hardcoded secrets)
5. Crypto issues (weak algorithms, hardcoded keys)
6. Race conditions (TOCTOU)
7. Resource exhaustion

**Exit Codes**:
- 0 = Safe
- 1 = Vulnerabilities found

---

### 6. GitHub Issue Classification

**Purpose**: Intelligent issue triaging

**Use Cases**:
- When creating GitHub issues
- During issue triage
- Sprint planning

**Usage**:
```bash
python lib/genai_validate.py classify-issue \
  --description "Login page crashes when password field is empty"
```

**Example Output**:
```
Type: bug
Priority: high
Component: authentication
Labels: bug, frontend, P1, security
Goal Alignment: Reliability and user experience
```

**Classifications**:
- **Type**: bug/feature/enhancement/refactoring/documentation/question
- **Priority**: critical/high/medium/low
- **Component**: Affected codebase area
- **Labels**: Suggested GitHub labels
- **Goal Alignment**: Which PROJECT.md goals this relates to

---

### 7. Commit Message Generation

**Purpose**: Generate semantic commit messages following conventions

**Use Cases**:
- Before committing
- During automated workflows
- Ensuring commit message quality

**Usage**:
```bash
# From staged changes
python lib/genai_validate.py commit-msg --use-git-diff
```

**Example Output**:
```
fix(auth): prevent crash on empty password field

Add null check in password validation to handle empty input gracefully.
Previously crashed with NullPointerException when user submitted form
without entering password.

Fixes #142
```

**Follows Conventional Commits**:
- Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build, revert
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Imperative mood, <72 chars, no period
- Body explains what and why (not how)

---

### 8. Version Consistency Validation

**Purpose**: Ensures all plugin version references are consistent

**Use Cases**:
- Before releases
- After updating VERSION file
- Documentation audits

**Usage**:
```bash
python lib/genai_validate.py version-sync --check
```

**Example Output**:
```
‚úÖ Version: v2.3.1
Plugin refs: 26 (Correct: 24, Incorrect: 2)
External refs: 98

‚ùå Incorrect plugin versions:
  README.md:42 - 2.3.0 (should be 2.3.1)
  plugins/autonomous-dev/README.md:15 - 2.1.0 (should be 2.3.1)
```

**How It Works**:
1. Reads VERSION file as single source of truth
2. Scans all .md files for version references
3. Uses GenAI to classify: plugin version vs external package version
4. Reports inconsistencies with file:line locations

**What It Correctly Ignores**:
- External packages: "anthropic 3.3.0", "pytest 23.11.0"
- Tool versions: "npm 5.12.0", "gh CLI 7.4.2"
- Python versions: "3.11.5"
- IP addresses: "192.168.1.1"
- Generic examples: "1.0.0" in semver docs

**Exit Codes**:
- 0 = All versions consistent
- 1 = Inconsistencies found

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No API key found"

```bash
# Set API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# OR
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...

# Or add to .env file
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." > .env
```

### "anthropic package not installed"

```bash
pip install anthropic
# OR for OpenRouter
pip install openai
```

### "Failed to parse GenAI response"

This is rare but can happen if:
1. API is temporarily unavailable
2. Response is malformed
3. Rate limits hit

**Solution**: Retry the command. The LLM is generally very reliable.

### High API costs

If you're not on Max Plan:
- Use regex validators for CI/CD (faster, cheaper)
- Use GenAI validators for releases only
- Consider OpenRouter for lower costs

| Commit Message | $0.0075 |
| Version Sync | $0.02 |

### Monthly Estimate (Solo Developer)

**Assumptions**:
- 100 commits/month
- 50 features/month
- 20 doc updates/month
- 100 code reviews/month

**Total**: ~$5.50-6.00/month

**ROI**: One prevented bug = hours saved = $100-500+ value

---

## Best Practices

### When to Use GenAI Validators

**Always**:
- Before releases (docs, version-sync, security)
- Before committing sensitive code (security)
- When uncertain about alignment (alignment)

**Often**:
- During code review (code-review, test-quality)
- When creating issues (classify-issue)
- When committing (commit-msg)

**Optionally**:
- Daily development (use regex for speed, GenAI for accuracy)
- CI/CD (GenAI is slower but more accurate)

### Combining with Regex Validators

**Fast Path** (CI/CD, pre-commit hooks):
1. Run regex validators first (< 1s)
2. If regex passes, skip GenAI
3. If regex fails, run GenAI for accuracy

**Accurate Path** (releases, manual validation):
1. Always use GenAI
2. Trust the results
3. No regex needed
