🚀 **Autonomous Dev v2.1.0 is now live on the Claude Code Commands Directory!**

https://claudecodecommands.directory/command/autonomous-dev

**What it does**: PROJECT.md-first autonomous development powered by 8 specialized agents. Auto-bootstraps knowledge base, validates alignment, handles formatting/testing/security/docs automatically.

**Key Features**:
✅ Knowledge base system (90% faster repeat research, 67% cost savings)
✅ 8-agent pipeline (orchestrator → planner → researcher → test-master → implementer → reviewer → security → docs)
✅ 21 discoverable commands (/test, /commit, /align-project, etc.)
✅ Cost-optimized (Opus for planning, Haiku for routine tasks)
✅ Works with Python, JS, TS, Go

**Install instantly**:
```bash
curl -o ~/.claude/commands/autonomous-dev.md https://claudecodecommands.directory/api/download/autonomous-dev
```
Or via plugin marketplace:
```bash
/plugin marketplace add akaszubski/autonomous-dev
/plugin install autonomous-dev
```

🚀 Excited to announce: Autonomous Dev v2.1.0 is now live on the Claude Code Commands Directory!

After months of development, I've published an open-source plugin that transforms Claude Code into an autonomous development system. It's designed to handle the tedious work automatically so developers can focus on creative problem-solving.

🎯 Key Innovation: PROJECT.md-First Architecture
Every feature gets validated against strategic goals before implementation. No more scope creep. No more misaligned work.

📚 Knowledge Base System (NEW in v2.1.0)
- Auto-bootstraps with Claude Code 2.0 best practices
- Caches research findings (90% faster on repeat topics)
- Reduces API costs by 67% on repeat research

🤖 8 Specialized Agents
orchestrator → planner (Opus) → researcher → test-master → implementer → reviewer → security-auditor (Haiku) → doc-master (Haiku)

Each agent is optimized for its task, using the right model for the job (Opus for complex planning, Haiku for routine tasks).

✅ Automatic Quality Enforcement
- Formatting (black, prettier)
- Testing (pytest, jest)
- Security scanning (OWASP)
- Documentation sync (API docs, CHANGELOG)
- GitHub integration (auto-create issues)

🔧 Works with: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go

📦 Install:
https://claudecodecommands.directory/command/autonomous-dev

📖 Documentation:
https://github.com/akaszubski/autonomous-dev

🎯 Why this matters:
Autonomous development isn't about replacing developers—it's about automating the repetitive work that slows us down. Format on save. Test on change. Validate against goals. Update docs automatically.

The result? More time for architecture, problem-solving, and creative engineering.

Open source (MIT). Free to use. Built for developers, by developers.

## Reddit Post (r/ClaudeAI, r/LocalLLaMA)

**Title**: [Plugin Release] Autonomous Dev v2.1.0 - Knowledge Base System + PROJECT.md-First Architecture

**Body**:

```
I've just released **Autonomous Dev v2.1.0** on the Claude Code Commands Directory!

## What it does

Transform Claude Code into an autonomous development system with 8 specialized agents that handle formatting, testing, security, and documentation automatically.

## Key Features

**Knowledge Base System (NEW in v2.1.0)**:
- Auto-bootstraps with Claude Code 2.0 best practices on first run
- Caches research findings (90% faster on repeat topics)
- 67% cost savings on repeat research via 7-day cache

**PROJECT.md-First Architecture**:
- Every feature validated against strategic goals before implementation
- Prevents scope creep
- Ensures alignment across team

**8 Specialized Agents**:
- orchestrator: Master coordinator
- planner: Architecture design (uses Opus for complex planning)
- researcher: Pattern discovery + web research
- test-master: TDD specialist (writes tests FIRST!)
- implementer: Production code
- reviewer: Quality gate
- security-auditor: OWASP compliance (uses Haiku for cost efficiency)
- doc-master: Documentation sync (uses Haiku)

**21 Discoverable Commands**:
- Testing: /test, /test-unit, /test-integration, /test-uat, /test-complete
- Commits: /commit, /commit-check, /commit-push, /commit-release
- Alignment: /align-project (5 variants)
- Issues: /issue-auto, /issue-from-test, /issue-from-genai
- Docs: /sync-docs (5 variants)
- Quality: /format, /security-scan, /full-check

**Automatic Quality Enforcement**:
- Auto-formats code (black, prettier) on save
- Auto-runs tests when code changes
- Auto-scans for security vulnerabilities
- Auto-updates documentation
- Auto-creates GitHub Issues from test failures

## Installation

**Via Command Directory**:
```bash
curl -o ~/.claude/commands/autonomous-dev.md https://claudecodecommands.directory/api/download/autonomous-dev
```

**Via Plugin Marketplace**:
```bash
/plugin marketplace add akaszubski/autonomous-dev
/plugin install autonomous-dev
```

## Results

Before v2.1.0:
- Research takes 15-20 minutes per topic
- API costs ~$0.30 per research session

After v2.1.0:
- Research takes 1-2 minutes (cached knowledge)
- API costs ~$0.10 per session (67% savings)
