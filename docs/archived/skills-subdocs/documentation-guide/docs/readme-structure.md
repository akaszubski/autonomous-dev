# README Structure Standards

## Standard Sections

A well-structured README should include:

1. **Project Title and Description**: One-sentence overview
2. **Features**: Bulleted list of key capabilities
3. **Installation**: Step-by-step setup instructions
4. **Quick Start**: Minimal working example
5. **Usage**: Common patterns and examples
6. **Configuration**: Environment variables and settings
7. **Documentation**: Links to detailed guides
8. **Contributing**: How to contribute (if open source)
9. **License**: Project license information

## Conciseness Guidelines

- **Keep README under 600 lines**: For detailed content, link to docs/ directory
- Use present tense and active voice
- Include code examples that actually work
- Link to detailed documentation for complex topics
- Update when public API changes

## README vs. Detailed Docs

- **README**: Quick start, overview, common patterns
- **docs/**: Detailed guides, API reference, architecture decisions

## File Paths

- Use `file:line` format when referencing code
- Validate all links before committing
- Keep relative paths when possible
