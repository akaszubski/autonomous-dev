"""

import sys
from pathlib import Path

def main():
    """Main hook logic."""
    # Your code here
    return 0  # 0 = success, non-zero = failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
```

**Testing**:
```bash
# Test hook locally
python plugins/autonomous-dev/hooks/my_hook.py

# Refresh settings
./scripts/refresh-claude-settings.sh
```
