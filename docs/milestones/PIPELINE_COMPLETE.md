## Lessons Learned

### 1. Artifact Protocol is Essential

**What We Learned**: Structured JSON artifacts enable agents to communicate reliably.

**Why It Matters**: Without artifacts, agents would have to parse logs or make assumptions.

**Applied**: All 8 agents use artifact protocol v2.0 for input/output.

### 2. Checkpoint Validation Prevents False Positives

**What We Learned**: Must validate artifact EXISTS, not just trust checkpoint claims.

**Why It Matters**: Agent may fail but checkpoint created in finally block claims success.

**Applied**: All checkpoint validations check `if artifact_path.exists()` before creating checkpoint.

### 3. Haiku Excels at Pattern Matching Tasks

**What We Learned**: Security-auditor (15 min) and doc-master (15 min) completed much faster than estimates (30 min).

**Why It Matters**: Haiku is fast, accurate, and cost-effective for structured tasks.

**Applied**: Use Haiku for scans, searches, pattern matching. Use Sonnet for code generation. Use Opus for complex architecture.

### 4. TDD Workflow Validated End-to-End

**What We Learned**: Test-master → Implementer workflow (RED → GREEN) works perfectly.

**Why It Matters**: Tests written first catch implementation issues immediately.

**Applied**: 27/27 unit tests passed on first implementer run. TDD proven effective.

### 5. Quality Gates Catch Critical Issues

**What We Learned**: Reviewer found 3 blocking issues (missing slash command, test imports).

**Why It Matters**: Without reviewer, we would have proceeded with incomplete implementation.

**Applied**: Quality gates (reviewer, security-auditor) are mandatory, not optional.

### 6. Zero Debugging After Patterns Established

**What We Learned**: Week 7 debugging (1 hour) established patterns. Weeks 8-12 had ZERO debugging.

**Why It Matters**: Mature patterns eliminate issues before they occur.

**Applied**: Document patterns, replicate for consistency.

### 7. Documentation as Final Validation

**What We Learned**: Doc-master ensures feature is truly user-ready.

**Why It Matters**: Code may work but users need docs to actually use it.

**Applied**: Documentation sync is mandatory final step.
