## What Was Built

### 1. Security-Auditor Agent (v2.0)

**File**: `.claude/agents/security-auditor.md` (deployed from `plugins/autonomous-dev/agents/security-auditor-v2.md`)

**Capabilities:**
- Scans for hardcoded secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- Validates subprocess injection prevention (no shell=True)
- Checks input validation (branch names, commits, patterns)
- Verifies timeout enforcement (DoS prevention)
- Validates error message safety (no credential leakage)
- Checks dependency security (vulnerable packages)
- Runs security test suite
- Validates threat model coverage

**Tools Available:**
- Read (read artifacts and code files)
- Bash (run tests, execute security scans)
- Grep (search for secrets and patterns)
- Glob (find files to scan)

**Model**: Claude Haiku (fast, cost-effective for automated security scans)

**Inputs:**
- `.claude/artifacts/{workflow_id}/manifest.json`
- `.claude/artifacts/{workflow_id}/architecture.json`
- `.claude/artifacts/{workflow_id}/implementation.json`
- `.claude/artifacts/{workflow_id}/review.json`
- Actual implementation files (`pr_automation.py`)

**Outputs:**
- `.claude/artifacts/{workflow_id}/security.json` (security audit report)

### 2. Orchestrator Integration

**File**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/orchestrator.py`

**New Methods:**

```python
def invoke_security_auditor(self, workflow_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Invoke security-auditor agent to scan for vulnerabilities

    Reads manifest, architecture, implementation, review artifacts.
    Prepares security-auditor invocation with complete prompt including
    security checks, threat model validation.

    Returns:
        Dict with subagent_type, description, prompt for Task tool
    """
```

```python
def invoke_security_auditor_with_task_tool(self, workflow_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Invoke security-auditor using real Task tool (Week 11+)

    Prepares invocation, logs events, creates checkpoint after completion
    ONLY if security.json artifact exists (Week 7 lesson applied).

    Returns:
        Dict with status, workflow_id, invocation params, expected artifact
    """
```

**Features:**
- Progress tracking (92% → security-auditor phase)
- Workflow logging (decision, task_tool_invocation, security_auditor_invoked events)
- Checkpoint creation ONLY if artifact exists
- Complete prompt with OWASP compliance checks

**Lines Added**: 296 lines (2 methods following established pattern)

|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| GITHUB_TOKEN exposure | CRITICAL | Token never in subprocess args, env only | ✅ MITIGATED |
| Accidental PR merge | HIGH | draft=True default, main branch check | ✅ MITIGATED |
| Rate limit exhaustion | MEDIUM | Error detection, graceful degradation | ✅ MITIGATED |
| Code injection via commits | CRITICAL | subprocess.run() with list args, no shell=True | ✅ MITIGATED |
| Insufficient token permissions | MEDIUM | gh auth status check, permission error handling | ✅ MITIGATED |

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Haiku Model Perfect for Security Scans

**Observation**: Security-auditor completed audit in 12 minutes (vs 30 min estimate).

**Lesson**: Haiku model is ideal for automated security scans - fast, accurate, cost-effective.

**Applied**: Use Haiku for pattern matching tasks (secrets detection, grep searches).

### 2. Security Tests as Documentation

**Observation**: Security tests serve dual purpose - validation AND documentation of security requirements.

**Lesson**: Test names like `test_no_github_token_in_code` clearly communicate security expectations.

**Applied**: Security tests document threat model implementation.

### 3. Threat Model Validation Critical

**Observation**: Security-auditor validated all 5 threats from architecture were mitigated.

**Lesson**: Threat model must be validated, not just assumed.

**Applied**: Security-auditor checks each threat from architecture.json individually.

## Conclusion

**Week 11 Status: 100% Complete**

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Security-auditor agent design and specification
- ✅ Orchestrator integration with checkpoint validation
- ✅ Task tool invocation (no issues!)
- ✅ Comprehensive security validation (secrets, injection, timeouts, validation)
- ✅ Threat model validation (100% coverage)
- ✅ Fast execution (Haiku model effective)

**What We Learned:**
- **Haiku perfect for scans**: Completed in 12 minutes (vs 30 min estimate)
- **Security tests as docs**: Test names communicate security requirements
- **Threat validation critical**: Must validate each threat individually
- **Patterns mature**: Fifth agent took only 1.1 hours with zero debugging

**Key Achievement:**

We successfully implemented the **security gate** in the autonomous development pipeline:

1. **Orchestrator** → Validates alignment, coordinates workflow
2. **Researcher** → Finds patterns, best practices, security considerations
3. **Planner** → Designs architecture with API contracts
4. **Test-Master** → Writes failing tests (TDD red)
5. **Implementer** → Makes tests pass (TDD green)
6. **Reviewer** → Validates quality (catches issues)
7. **Security-Auditor** → Validates security (scans for vulnerabilities) ✨

**This is the first pipeline with complete security validation!**

**Next:** Week 12 - Doc-master agent (documentation sync) - THE FINAL AGENT!
