## What Was Built

### 1. Reviewer Agent (v2.0)

**File**: `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` (deployed from `plugins/autonomous-dev/agents/reviewer-v2.md`)

**Capabilities:**
- Reads implementation.json and actual code files
- Validates type hints (100% required)
- Validates docstrings (Google-style, 100% required)
- Checks error handling completeness
- Runs tests and verifies coverage (≥90%)
- Security checks (no secrets, timeouts, validation)
- Creates review.json with approve/changes_requested decision

**Tools Available:**
- Read (read artifacts and code files)
- Bash (run tests, check coverage)
- Grep (search code patterns)
- Glob (find files)

**Model**: Claude Sonnet (cost-effective for code review)

**Inputs:**
- `.claude/artifacts/{workflow_id}/manifest.json`
- `.claude/artifacts/{workflow_id}/architecture.json`
- `.claude/artifacts/{workflow_id}/tests.json`
- `.claude/artifacts/{workflow_id}/implementation.json`
- Actual implementation files (`pr_automation.py`)

**Outputs:**
- `.claude/artifacts/{workflow_id}/review.json` (review report)

### 2. Orchestrator Integration

**File**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/orchestrator.py`

**New Methods:**

```python
def invoke_reviewer(self, workflow_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Invoke reviewer agent to validate code quality

    Reads manifest, architecture, tests, implementation artifacts.
    Prepares reviewer invocation with complete prompt including
    quality requirements, decision criteria.

    Returns:
        Dict with subagent_type, description, prompt for Task tool
    """
```

```python
def invoke_reviewer_with_task_tool(self, workflow_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Invoke reviewer using real Task tool (Week 10+)

    Prepares invocation, logs events, creates checkpoint after completion
    ONLY if review.json artifact exists (Week 7 lesson applied).

    Returns:
        Dict with status, workflow_id, invocation params, expected artifact
    """
```

**Features:**
- Progress tracking (85% → reviewer phase)
- Workflow logging (decision, task_tool_invocation, reviewer_invoked events)
- Checkpoint creation ONLY if artifact exists
- Complete prompt with quality criteria

**Lines Added**: 302 lines (2 methods following established pattern)

- ✅ 27/27 unit tests passing
- ✅ Helpful error messages with context
- ✅ Follows project patterns

**Functions Implemented:**
1. `validate_gh_prerequisites()` - 53 lines, 3 tests, EXCELLENT
2. `get_current_branch()` - 42 lines, 3 tests, EXCELLENT
3. `parse_commit_messages_for_issues()` - 53 lines, 6 tests, EXCELLENT
4. `create_pull_request()` - 192 lines, 15 tests, VERY GOOD

### Issues Found: 5 (3 Blocking)

**Decision: CHANGES_REQUESTED**

#### Blocking Issues:

1. **CRITICAL**: Missing `/pr-create` slash command
   - Users have no way to invoke PR automation
   - Fix: Create `plugins/autonomous-dev/commands/pr-create.md`
   - Effort: 15 minutes

2. **HIGH**: Integration tests skipped (8 tests)
   - Import path issue with hyphenated directory
   - Fix: Use `sys.path` manipulation like unit tests
   - Effort: 5 minutes

3. **HIGH**: Security tests skipped (6 tests)
   - Same import path issue
   - Fix: Use `sys.path` manipulation like unit tests
   - Effort: 5 minutes

#### Non-Blocking Issues:

4. **MEDIUM**: Documentation not updated (4 files)
   - Missing `/pr-create` examples
   - Effort: 20 minutes

5. **LOW**: Coverage measurement blocked
   - Can't measure due to import pattern
   - Estimated 95%+ coverage
   - Effort: Accept estimated coverage

**Total Fix Time**: 45 minutes

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Quality Gate Works As Designed

**Observation**: Reviewer found 3 blocking issues that would prevent users from using the feature.

**Lesson**: Quality gates are essential. Without reviewer, we would have proceeded to security audit with incomplete implementation.

**Impact**: Saves time by catching issues early (before security audit and documentation).

### 2. Test Coverage Validation Critical

**Observation**: Integration and security tests were written but never run due to import issue.

**Lesson**: Reviewer must actually RUN tests, not just check if they exist.

**Applied**: Reviewer now runs `pytest` commands and reports results.

### 3. Completeness ≠ Quality

**Observation**: Core library is excellent (9.5/10 quality) but feature is incomplete (60% complete).

**Lesson**: Must validate user experience, not just code quality.

**Applied**: Reviewer checks for slash commands and documentation.

## What's Next

### Week 11: Security-Auditor Integration

**Goal:** Security validation and threat model verification

**Deliverables:**
1. Security-auditor agent spec (v2.0)
2. Orchestrator.invoke_security_auditor() method

2. Documentation updates artifact (docs.json)
3. Updated PR-AUTOMATION.md with examples
4. Updated GITHUB-WORKFLOW.md with diagrams
5. Updated .env.example with PR config
6. Updated README.md with /pr-create command

## Conclusion

**Week 10 Status: 100% Complete**

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Reviewer agent design and specification
- ✅ Orchestrator integration with checkpoint validation
- ✅ Task tool invocation (no issues!)
- ✅ Comprehensive code quality analysis
- ✅ Quality gate caught blocking issues
- ✅ Decision criteria applied correctly

**What We Learned:**
- **Quality gates work**: Reviewer found 3 issues that would block users
- **Test execution matters**: Must RUN tests, not just check they exist
- **Completeness critical**: Excellent code isn't useful without slash commands
- **Patterns mature**: Fourth agent (reviewer) took 1.3 hours with zero debugging

**Key Achievement:**

We successfully implemented the **quality gate** in the autonomous development pipeline:

1. **Orchestrator** → Validates alignment, coordinates workflow
2. **Researcher** → Finds patterns, best practices, security considerations
3. **Planner** → Designs architecture with API contracts
4. **Test-Master** → Writes failing tests (TDD red)
5. **Implementer** → Makes tests pass (TDD green)
6. **Reviewer** → Validates quality (catches issues) ✨

**This is the first pipeline with quality validation!**

**Next:** Week 11 - Security-auditor agent (security validation and threat model verification)
