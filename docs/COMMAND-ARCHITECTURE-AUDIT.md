# Command Architecture Audit: GenAI Refactoring Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Scope**: All 9 commands in autonomous-dev plugin
**Purpose**: Identify which commands need refactoring to leverage GenAI agents vs. Python-based automation

---

## Executive Summary

**Commands needing refactoring: 3**
- **HIGH**: `/align-project` (strategic validation - core command)
- **MEDIUM**: `/status` (goal tracking - developer tool)
- **LOW**: `/sync-dev` (file syncing - dev-only)

**Commands that are OK: 6**
- `/auto-implement` ‚úÖ Already refactored to GenAI orchestration
- `/test` ‚úÖ Simple bash invocation, no orchestration needed
- `/health-check` ‚úÖ Acceptable (minor improvement optional)
- `/setup` ‚úÖ Interactive wizard (human-driven, not automated)
- `/uninstall` ‚úÖ Interactive removal (human-driven, not automated)
- `/align-claude` ‚úÖ Already GenAI-native

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `/auto-implement` ‚úÖ ALREADY REFACTORED

**Status**: DONE
**Complexity**: HIGH
**Architecture**: GenAI-native orchestration (orchestrator agent)

**Current Implementation**:
```markdown
Autonomously implement a feature by invoking the orchestrator agent.

The orchestrator agent:
1. Validates alignment with PROJECT.md
2. Researches patterns
3. Plans implementation
4. Writes tests (TDD)
5. Implements code
6. Reviews quality
7. Security scans
8. Updates documentation
```

**Why This is Good**:
- ‚úÖ Uses Task tool to invoke specialist agents
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator coordinates complex workflow
- ‚úÖ Claude's reasoning adapts to discoveries
- ‚úÖ Handles edge cases intelligently
- ‚úÖ No Python orchestration overhead

**No Changes Needed**: This command exemplifies the GenAI-native approach.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `/align-project` ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REFACTORING

**Status**: NEEDS REFACTORING
**Priority**: HIGH (core command, validates strategic direction)
**Complexity**: MEDIUM

**Current Implementation**:
```markdown
Invoke the alignment-analyzer agent to analyze PROJECT.md against current project state.

Shows interactive menu for fixing issues:
- Option 1: View report only
- Option 2: Fix interactively (3-phase)
- Option 3: Dry run preview
- Option 4: Cancel
```

**Problem**:
- ‚ùå Documentation says "invoke alignment-analyzer agent"
- ‚ùå But description doesn't show actual GenAI reasoning
- ‚ùå Relies on Python analysis underneath
- ‚ùå Should be pure GenAI analysis with interactive fixing

**Proposed Refactoring**:

Replace Python-based validation with GenAI agent that:

1. **Analysis Phase** (GenAI)
   - Agent reads PROJECT.md
   - Analyzes current project state
   - Identifies alignment issues
   - Explains what's wrong and why it matters
   - Presents issues clearly

2. **Interactive Fixing** (GenAI + User)
   - Agent proposes fixes for each issue
   - User approves/modifies each phase
   - Agent explains impact of changes
   - Agent can ask clarifying questions

3. **Execution** (Bash + GenAI)
   - Agent creates directories
   - Agent moves files
   - Agent updates documentation
   - Shows what was actually changed

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Users can customize validation logic
- ‚úÖ Agent can ask clarifying questions
- ‚úÖ Better error messages
- ‚úÖ Adapts to project variations
- ‚úÖ Extensible (add new checks easily)

**Example Workflow**:
```
/align-project

ü§ñ Analyzing project structure...

Found 5 alignment issues:

1. ‚ùå CRITICAL: Missing test directories
   Expected: tests/unit/, tests/integration/
   Impact: Cannot run automated tests
   Fix: Create directories? [Y/n]

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: README outdated
   Last update: 7 days ago (PROJECT.md: 2 days ago)
   Fix: Rebuild README.md? [Y/n]

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Docs scattered
   Files: GUIDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md in root
   Expected: docs/ subdirectory
   Fix: Organize? [Y/n]

Applying fixes...
‚úÖ Phase 1: Created test directories
‚úÖ Phase 2: Moved docs to docs/ folder
‚úÖ Phase 3: Rebuilt README.md
‚úÖ All fixes applied and committed!
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `/test` ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE

**Status**: OK AS-IS
**Complexity**: SIMPLE
**Architecture**: Direct bash invocation

**Current Implementation**:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

**Why This is Good**:
- ‚úÖ Simple, direct bash command
- ‚úÖ No orchestration needed
- ‚úÖ Not coordinating multiple agents
- ‚úÖ Users understand what's happening
- ‚ùå Could benefit from GenAI analysis of failures (future improvement)

**No Changes Needed**: Bash invocation is appropriate for test running.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ `/status` ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REFACTORING

**Status**: NEEDS REFACTORING
**Priority**: MEDIUM (nice-to-have improvement)
**Complexity**: LOW

**Current Implementation**:
```markdown
Invoke the project-progress-tracker agent to analyze project status.

Shows:
- Goal Progress: Completion % for each PROJECT.md goal
- Active Workflows: Currently running autonomous workflows
- Recent Activity: Last completed feature
- Next Priorities: Suggested features based on progress
```

**Problem**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation mentions agent but lacks GenAI reasoning details
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Should let agent think about goal completion intelligently
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Should adapt based on what it discovers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could provide better strategic recommendations

**Proposed Refactoring**:

Let GenAI agent analyze project progress with reasoning:

1. **Analysis** (GenAI)
   - Parse PROJECT.md GOALS section
   - Check git history for completed features
   - Analyze session logs for what was accomplished
   - Calculate progress intelligently (not just counting)

2. **Strategic Thinking** (GenAI)
   - Which goals are neglected?
   - Which goals are closest to completion?
   - What's the logical next priority?
   - Are we aligned with strategic direction?

3. **Reporting** (GenAI)
   - Show visual progress bars
   - Highlight risks or misalignment
   - Suggest next actions
   - Flag incomplete work

**Example Output**:
```
üìä PROJECT.md Goal Progress

Enhanced UX:       [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë] 80% (4/5 features)
  ‚úÖ Responsive design
  ‚úÖ Accessibility improvements
  ‚úÖ Dark mode toggle
  ‚úÖ User preferences
  ‚è≥ Keyboard shortcuts (Next priority)

Security:          [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà] 100% ‚úÖ COMPLETE

Performance:       [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 20% (1/5 features)
  ‚úÖ Basic caching
  ‚è≥ Rate limiting (should do soon)
  ‚è≥ Query optimization
  ‚è≥ Compression
  ‚è≥ CDN integration

üéØ Strategic Analysis:
- UX nearly complete (1 feature away)
- Security done, should maintain
- Performance neglected (only 20%)
  ‚Üí Consider: Implement rate limiting next
  ‚Üí Reason: Enables 40% progress, improves stability
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Adaptive priority suggestions
- ‚úÖ Intelligent progress calculation
- ‚úÖ Identifies neglected goals
- ‚úÖ Better strategic guidance
- ‚úÖ Can flag quality issues in sessions

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ `/sync-dev` ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REFACTORING

**Status**: NEEDS REFACTORING
**Priority**: LOW (developer-only, non-critical)
**Complexity**: LOW

**Current Implementation**:
```markdown
Invoke the project-bootstrapper agent to copy all files from
plugins/autonomous-dev/ to the installed Claude Code plugin directory.

Copies:
- agents/, skills/, commands/, hooks/
- scripts/, templates/, docs/
```

**Problem**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Says it invokes agent but just copies files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No reasoning about what changed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dumb file copy, not intelligent syncing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't validate integrity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No change detection

**Proposed Refactoring**:

Let GenAI agent intelligently sync with change detection:

1. **Change Detection** (GenAI)
   - Compare local vs. installed files
   - Identify what's actually different
   - Skip unchanged files (faster)
   - Report summary of changes

2. **Intelligent Syncing** (GenAI)
   - Copy only changed files
   - Preserve user customizations
   - Warn about conflicts
   - Ask before overwriting

3. **Validation** (GenAI)
   - Verify copy completed successfully
   - Check file counts match
   - Validate critical files present
   - Report any failures

4. **User Guidance** (GenAI)
   - Suggest restart if needed
   - Show what was synced
   - Explain if changes won't take effect yet

**Example Workflow**:
```
/sync-dev

üîç Detecting changes...

Changed files:
  ‚úèÔ∏è  agents/orchestrator.md (updated)
  ‚úèÔ∏è  commands/auto-implement.md (updated)
  ‚ûï commands/new-command.md (new)
  ‚ûñ hooks/deprecated-hook.py (removed locally)

üîÑ Syncing to installed location...

‚úÖ agents/orchestrator.md (sync'd)
‚úÖ commands/auto-implement.md (sync'd)
‚úÖ commands/new-command.md (sync'd)
‚ö†Ô∏è  hooks/deprecated-hook.py (exists in installed, removed locally)
   Keep in installed? [Y/n]: n
   ‚úÖ Removed from installed

üîç Verifying...
‚úÖ 59 items synced
‚úÖ File integrity validated

‚ö†Ô∏è  RESTART REQUIRED
Claude Code must be restarted to pick up changes:
1. Save your work
2. Quit Claude Code (Cmd+Q)
3. Restart Claude Code
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Faster syncing (only copies changed files)
- ‚úÖ Better change awareness
- ‚úÖ Intelligent conflict handling
- ‚úÖ Better user feedback
- ‚úÖ Validates integrity

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ `/health-check` ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE (Minor Improvement Optional)

**Status**: OK AS-IS (optional future improvement)
**Complexity**: SIMPLE
**Architecture**: Python validation script

**Current Implementation**:
```bash
python lib/health_check.py

Validates:
- 8 agents loaded
- 14 skills loaded
- 8 hooks executable
- 7 commands present
```

**Why This is Good**:
- ‚úÖ Quick, reliable validation
- ‚úÖ Doesn't need GenAI reasoning
- ‚úÖ Clear pass/fail results
- ‚úÖ Good error reporting

**Optional Improvement** (can do later):

If desired, let GenAI agent think more deeply about health:

```
/health-check

üîç Checking plugin components...

‚úÖ Agents: 8/8 loaded
‚úÖ Commands: 8/8 present
‚úÖ Hooks: 8/8 executable

üß† System Analysis:
- All components loaded correctly
- No missing dependencies
- Agents can invoke each other
- Hooks are executable

‚úÖ OVERALL STATUS: HEALTHY

Can verify:
- Try invoking agents? [Y/n]
- Run test suite? [Y/n]
```

**Recommendation**: Leave as-is for now. Improve later if needed.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ `/setup` ‚úÖ OK AS-IS

**Status**: OK AS-IS
**Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Architecture**: Interactive wizard (human-driven)

**Current Implementation**:
```
Interactive wizard with 6 phases:
1. Hook setup (slash commands vs. auto hooks)
2. PROJECT.md template/generation
3. GitHub integration (optional)
4. Settings validation
5. Final setup confirmation
```

**Why This is Good**:
- ‚úÖ Designed for human interaction
- ‚úÖ Doesn't need GenAI reasoning
- ‚úÖ User making intentional choices
- ‚úÖ Clear workflow
- ‚ùå Could use GenAI to generate PROJECT.md better (already done!)

**No Changes Needed**: Interactive wizard is the right pattern for setup.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ `/uninstall` ‚úÖ OK AS-IS

**Status**: OK AS-IS
**Complexity**: SIMPLE
**Architecture**: Interactive removal (human-driven)

**Current Implementation**:
```
Interactive menu with 6 options:
1. Disable automatic hooks only
2. Remove project files only
3. Remove hooks and templates
4. Remove all project files
5. Uninstall plugin globally
6. Cancel
```

**Why This is Good**:
- ‚úÖ Safe, reversible operations
- ‚úÖ Clear options presented
- ‚úÖ User makes final choice
- ‚úÖ Doesn't need GenAI reasoning
- ‚úÖ Good error prevention

**No Changes Needed**: Interactive removal is the right pattern for uninstall.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ `/align-claude` ‚úÖ ALREADY GENAI-NATIVE

**Status**: DONE
**Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Architecture**: Validation + guidance system

**Current Implementation**:
```markdown
Check and fix drift between documented standards (CLAUDE.md)
and actual implementation.

Validates:
1. Version consistency
2. Agent counts
3. Command counts
4. Documented features exist
5. Skills deprecation
6. Hook documentation
```

**Why This is Good**:
- ‚úÖ Uses validation script for facts
- ‚úÖ Clear issue reporting
- ‚úÖ Provides fix guidance
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hook prevents drift
- ‚úÖ Good example of validation pattern

**No Changes Needed**: This command validates well without full GenAI orchestration.

## Design Principles for GenAI Commands

When refactoring commands to GenAI, follow these principles:

### 1. **Prefer Agents Over Scripts**
```
‚ùå Old approach:
python scripts/analyze.py
‚Üí Parse JSON
‚Üí Format output

‚úÖ New approach:
Agent reads PROJECT.md
Agent thinks about issues
Agent explains to user
```

### 2. **Embrace Reasoning**
```
‚ùå Old: "15 directories found"
‚úÖ New: "You're missing test directories.
        This prevents automated testing.
        Should I create them?"
```

### 3. **Interactive When It Matters**
```
‚ùå Old: Auto-fix everything
‚úÖ New: Ask user before each phase
        Explain impact of each change
        Let user customize
```

### 4. **Use Task Tool for Coordination**
```
‚úÖ Good: Agent invokes sub-agents with Task tool
‚úÖ Good: Wait for each agent to complete
‚úÖ Good: Adapt based on results

‚ùå Bad: Python script coordinating agents
‚ùå Bad: Rigid sequence that can't adapt
```

### 5. **Keep Shell Commands Simple**
```
‚úÖ Good: Agent decides what to run, then runs it
‚úÖ Good: Agent explains what it's doing

‚ùå Bad: Complex bash orchestration
‚ùå Bad: Hidden operations users don't see
```

## Conclusion

The autonomous-dev plugin is well-architected with:
- ‚úÖ 2 exemplar GenAI commands (`/auto-implement`, `/align-claude`)
- ‚úÖ 4 appropriately simple commands (`/test`, `/setup`, `/uninstall`, `/health-check`)
- üî¥ 3 commands that need GenAI refactoring

**Recommended Action**: Start with `/align-project` (HIGH priority) to establish the pattern, then tackle `/status` and `/sync-dev`.

The refactoring will make commands:
- More adaptive and intelligent
- More customizable for different projects
- Better at explaining what they're doing
- More aligned with GenAI-native architecture
