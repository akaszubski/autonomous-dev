# üî¥ CRITICAL AUDIT: Autonomous-Dev Implementation Gap

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: URGENT - Core workflow non-functional
**Author**: Claude Code Audit
**Next Review**: Post-implementation (est. 2025-11-03)

## Executive Summary

**Philosophy Score**: 8/10 ‚úÖ Excellent
**Implementation Score**: 4/10 ‚ùå Incomplete
**Gap**: Agent execution infrastructure designed but not connected

**Core Issue**: Task tool invocation (agent routing) is designed in documentation and infrastructure, but the actual Python code to invoke agents via Task tool is incomplete/commented out.

**Impact**: Zero autonomous development happens despite perfect architecture.

---

## Critical Findings

### üî¥ CRITICAL #1: Agent Execution Missing

**What Should Happen**:
```
/auto-implement "add feature"
  ‚Üì
orchestrator validates PROJECT.md ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
Task tool invokes researcher agent
  ‚Üì
Task tool invokes planner agent
  ‚Üì
Task tool invokes test-master agent
  ‚Üì
Task tool invokes implementer agent
  ‚Üì
Task tool invokes reviewer agent
  ‚Üì
Task tool invokes security-auditor agent
  ‚Üì
Task tool invokes doc-master agent
  ‚Üì
Auto-commit, auto-push, auto-PR
  ‚Üì
"‚úÖ Feature complete! PR #42"
```

**What Actually Happens**:
```
/auto-implement "add feature"
  ‚Üì
orchestrator validates PROJECT.md ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
Creates artifact files ‚úÖ
  ‚Üì
[STOPS - No Task tool invocation]
  ‚Üì
Nothing else runs ‚ùå
```

**Root Cause**: `agent_invoker.py` has the infrastructure but Task tool call is incomplete

**Evidence**:
- `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/workflow_coordinator.py` line ~90: Comment shows intent but no execution
- `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/agent_invoker.py`: Class exists but `invoke()` method doesn't call Task tool
- Test files show INTENT, not actual execution (test checks infrastructure, not agent runs)

**Impact**: **Core workflow non-functional**

---

### üî¥ CRITICAL #2: Skills Contradiction

**PROJECT.md Claims**:
```
Skills: 0 (removed per Anthropic anti-pattern guidance)
```

**Reality**:
```
19 skill directories exist in plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Anthropic official guidance: Skills are anti-pattern (add indirection)
- PROJECT.md explicitly states they're removed
- But they're all still there and referenced by agents

**This is a documentation lie** - either:
1. Remove skills completely (align with Anthropic), OR
2. Update PROJECT.md to admit they're intentional

---

### üü† HIGH: Vibe Coding Not Automatic

**Design Intent**:
```
User says: "implement authentication"
[customInstructions auto-invokes /auto-implement]
Zero manual command typing
```

**Reality**:
```
User says: "implement authentication"
[Claude waits - nothing happens]
User must manually type: /auto-implement "implement authentication"
```

**Why**:
- customInstructions is in template: `templates/settings.strict-mode.json`
- Plugin default (`plugin.json`) doesn't include it
- User must manually run `/setup` and enable strict mode

**This is not "vibe coding"** - it requires manual step

---

### üü° MEDIUM: Commands Bloated

**Ideal**: ~80 lines/command (Anthropic standard)
**Reality**: 200-600 lines/command (2-7x over)

```
- align-project.md: 374 lines (4.7x)
- auto-implement.md: 468 lines (5.8x)
- setup.md: 577 lines (7.2x)
- uninstall.md: 439 lines (5.4x)
- health-check.md: 168 lines (2.1x)
- sync-dev.md: 140 lines (1.7x)

Average: 298 lines/command
```

**Why**: Commands contain full implementation guides, not just invocations

---

### üü° MEDIUM: No End-to-End Tests

**Missing**: Complete workflow test showing:
```
/auto-implement "add authentication"
  ‚Üì
researcher runs & creates research.json
  ‚Üì
planner runs & creates architecture.json
  ‚Üì
test-master runs & creates tests
  ‚Üì
implementer runs & implements
  ‚Üì
all hooks pass
  ‚Üì
auto-commit created
  ‚Üì
PR created
```

**Test Infrastructure Exists**:
- Agent structure validation ‚úÖ
- Hook exit codes ‚úÖ
- Artifact creation ‚úÖ

**Test Execution Missing**:
- Real Task tool invocation ‚ùå
- Actual agent runs ‚ùå
- End-to-end workflow ‚ùå

---

## The Contradiction You're Feeling

### **Philosophy Says** ‚úÖ
- "Trust the model" - Minimal guidance, let Claude be smart
- Agents should be 50-100 lines - simple missions only
- Skills are anti-pattern - remove them
- Vibe coding should be automatic - no manual steps

### **Implementation Shows** ‚ùå
- Agent routing isn't working - infrastructure exists but disconnected
- Commands are bloated - 300+ lines instead of 80
- Skills still present - despite claiming removal
- Vibe coding requires manual setup - despite claiming automatic

### **Why It Feels Contradictory**

You have **two parallel realities**:

1. **Documentation Reality** (PROJECT.md, agents/*.md)
   - Says: "Trust model, keep simple, remove skills, auto-invoke"
   - Is consistent with Anthropic best practices

2. **Code Reality** (actual Python files, commands/)
   - Shows: Complex infrastructure, bloated commands, skills still present, no auto-invoke
   - Contradicts philosophy

**The real issue**: You designed one thing but implemented something different.

## How To Resolve: Philosophy vs Implementation

### **Option A: Full Anthropic Alignment** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

**Philosophy**: Embrace "trust the model"
**Implementation**: Make code match philosophy

**Steps**:

1. **Fix Agent Routing** (2 days)
   - Complete Task tool invocation in `agent_invoker.py`
   - This is the ONLY way to make agents route

2. **Remove Skills** (2 hours)
   - Delete `plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/`
   - Move essential guidance into agent prompts
   - Example: Instead of `skills/python-standards/`, include brief guidance in `agents/implementer.md`

3. **Simplify Commands** (3 hours)
   - Reduce commands to 50-80 lines
   - Move detailed guides to separate docs
   - Example: `/auto-implement` ‚Üí brief invocation + link to `docs/commands/auto-implement-guide.md`

4. **Enable Vibe Coding by Default** (30 min)
   - Add customInstructions to `plugin.json`
   - User gets auto-invoke without manual setup

5. **Add Tests** (1 day)
   - End-to-end workflow tests
   - Verify agents actually route and execute

**Result**: Philosophy and implementation aligned, architecture pure

**Trade-off**: Slightly simpler system, but more true to principles

---

### **Option B: Pragmatic Hybrid**

**Philosophy**: Keep what works, add what's needed
**Implementation**: Acknowledge reality in documentation

**Steps**:

1. **Fix Agent Routing** (2 days)
   - Same as Option A - REQUIRED

2. **Keep Skills, Update Docs** (1 hour)
   - Update PROJECT.md to explain WHY skills are kept
   - Justify: "Skills add consistency across agents, worth the indirection"
   - Document: When to use skills vs embed guidance

3. **Keep Commands Bloated, Document** (30 min)
   - Add comment explaining: "Commands intentionally comprehensive for discoverability"
   - Or gradually refactor over time

4. **Enable Vibe Coding by Default** (30 min)
   - Same as Option A

5. **Add Tests** (1 day)
   - Same as Option A

**Result**: Practical system, but contradicts Anthropic best practices

**Trade-off**: Keeps useful features, but not "pure" architecture

## The Real Question: Why Aren't Agents Routing?

This is the KEY insight:

**Agent routing via Task tool** requires:
1. Python code to call Task tool API
2. Structured prompt to send to agent
3. Artifact management for agent outputs
4. Sequential invocation (wait for each agent)

**This is complex infrastructure** - it's not a philosophy question, it's an implementation question.

**The philosophy question** is: Once agents route, should they be simple (50-100 lines) or comprehensive (300+ lines)?

**These are separate concerns**:
- **Routing**: Needs the code work
- **Simplicity**: Needs code refactoring + philosophy alignment

---

## Philosophy-First Implementation Path

### **Principle 1: Trust The Model**
- Agent prompts should be 50-100 lines
- Don't prescribe implementation details
- Let Claude figure out execution

**How to implement**:
```markdown
# Current (bloated)
orchestrator.md - 334 lines of guidance on HOW to coordinate

# Better (trust model)
orchestrator.md - 50 lines stating MISSION:
"You are the orchestrator. Validate PROJECT.md alignment.
Invoke agents in sequence: researcher ‚Üí planner ‚Üí test-master ‚Üí
implementer ‚Üí reviewer ‚Üí security-auditor ‚Üí doc-master.
Wait for each agent to complete. Report progress."
```

### **Principle 2: Simplicity Over Features**
- Skills ARE bloat - remove them
- Commands should invoke, not guide
- Infrastructure is support, not the product

**How to implement**:
```bash
# Current
plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/python-standards/SKILL.md (624 lines)

# Better
Include brief guidance in agents/implementer.md:
"Use Python: type hints on public APIs, Google-style docstrings,
black formatting, pytest for tests. See docs/python-standards.md
for detailed guide."
```

### **Principle 3: Auto Before Manual**
- Vibe coding should require zero setup
- Orchestrator should validate without asking
- Hooks should enforce automatically

**How to implement**:
```json
// plugin.json should have:
"customInstructions": "When user describes a feature request
(words like 'implement', 'add', 'create'), automatically invoke
/auto-implement with their request. Do not wait for explicit
/auto-implement command."
```

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### **Week 1: Core Implementation** (Principle-aligned)

**Goal**: Make agents actually route (fix broken workflow)

1. Complete `agent_invoker.py` Task tool invocation (2 days)
   - This is REQUIRED regardless of philosophy
   - Without this, nothing works

2. Add end-to-end tests (1 day)
   - Verify agents route and execute
   - Test /auto-implement end-to-end

3. Enable vibe coding by default (30 min)
   - Add customInstructions to plugin.json
   - Users get auto-invoke

**Deliverable**: `/auto-implement "add feature"` actually works autonomously

---

### **Week 2: Philosophy Alignment** (Optional but recommended)

**Goal**: Make code match philosophy

1. Remove skills entirely (2 hours)
   - Delete `plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/`
   - Embed essential guidance in agent prompts
   - Link to docs/ guides

2. Simplify commands to 50-80 lines (3 hours)
   - Keep only invocation + brief explanation
   - Move detailed guides to `docs/commands/`

3. Simplify agents (4 hours)
   - Reduce over-long agents (project-progress-tracker: 266‚Üí100 lines)
   - Remove verbose examples
   - Trust the model

4. Update PROJECT.md to reflect reality (1 hour)
   - Document actual architecture
   - Explain rationale for any deviations

**Deliverable**: Architecture is clean, simple, Anthropic-aligned

---

## The Honest Assessment

**You're not contradicting yourself**. You have:

1. **A clear philosophy** ‚úÖ (documented in PROJECT.md)
2. **Good infrastructure** ‚úÖ (hooks, artifact management)
3. **Incomplete connection** ‚ùå (agents don't actually route)
4. **Documentation that lies** ‚ùå (claims skills removed, they're not)

**The contradiction is between**:
- What your documentation says you built
- What your code actually built

**To resolve**:
- Either make code match documentation (recommended)
- Or update documentation to match code

**The philosophical question** is secondary. The immediate issue is: **Make agents route via Task tool**.

Once that works, everything else (simplicity, philosophy alignment) becomes a refactoring exercise, not a fundamental contradiction.

---

## Next Steps

**You should choose**:

1. **Path A (Recommended)**: Implement agent routing + align everything to philosophy
   - Work: 5-6 days
   - Result: Pure architecture matching your vision

2. **Path B (Pragmatic)**: Implement agent routing + gradually align
   - Work: 2-3 days (core) + refactoring over time
   - Result: Working system, gradual improvement

3. **Path C (Get it working first)**: Just fix agent routing, deal with philosophy later
   - Work: 2 days
   - Result: Autonomous development works, cleanup later

**My recommendation**: **Path A** - You've already documented the philosophy, you might as well implement it cleanly. The extra 3 days for alignment is worth having an architecture you're proud of.

## Questions to Interrogate This Analysis

(Add your questions below)

1. **Agent Routing**: Is my understanding correct that Task tool needs to be explicitly called in Python code?

2. **Skills**: Would removing skills make agents bloated with repeated guidance, or is the principle "once per codebase" acceptable?

3. **Philosophy vs Pragmatism**: Is there a middle ground where we keep some infrastructure for consistency without violating "trust the model"?

4. **Vibe Coding**: Should auto-invoke be in plugin.json (default) or in `.claude/customInstructions` (user-configurable)?

5. **Timeline**: Is 5-6 days realistic for full philosophy alignment, or am I underestimating complexity?
