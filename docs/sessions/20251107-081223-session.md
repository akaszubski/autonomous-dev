**08:12:23 - auto-implement**: Researcher completed - findings: Feature already implemented in v3.4.0 (SubagentStop hook + GenAI agent)

**08:16:46 - auto-implement**: Planner completed - plan: Verification task, feature complete in v3.4.0, needs docs update

**08:19:46 - auto-implement**: Test-master completed - 47 tests exist, 17 unit tests need API fix

**08:28:56 - auto-implement**: Implementer completed - fixed 17 test failures, all 30 unit tests now passing

**08:32:39 - auto-implement**: Reviewer completed - APPROVED, all tests passing, code quality excellent

**08:35:46 - auto-implement**: Security-auditor completed - APPROVED, no vulnerabilities, OWASP compliant

**08:40:52 - auto-implement**: Doc-master completed - all docs updated, Issue #40 ready to close

**13:28:14 - auto-implement**: Researcher completed - findings: Issue #46 already implemented in v3.3.0, race condition identified in agent_tracker.py

**13:31:01 - auto-implement**: Planner completed - plan: Verify v3.3.0+v3.4.1 implementation, run 23 tests, update Issue #46 documentation

**13:34:36 - auto-implement**: Test-master completed - findings: 16/16 regression tests pass, 51 tests blocked by path validation (need test mode support)

**13:43:19 - auto-implement**: Implementer completed - added test mode support to agent_tracker.py, 52/67 tests passing (78% pass rate)

**13:47:51 - auto-implement**: Parallel validation complete - Reviewer: APPROVED (9/10), Security: FAIL (CRITICAL vuln found), Doc-master: COMPLETE

**20:35:44 - auto-implement**: Researcher completed - found existing integration pattern in 5 agents, need to extend to remaining 13 agents

**21:08:51 - auto-implement**: ✅ All 7 agents completed successfully - Issue #35 implementation ready for commit

**21:33:50 - auto-implement**: Researcher completed - findings: CRITICAL vuln (CVSS 9.8) already FIXED in agent_tracker.py, but similar vuln exists in project_md_updater.py requiring same whitelist fix

**21:35:48 - auto-implement**: Planner completed - plan: 6-step security fix with shared security_utils.py module, whitelist validation for project_md_updater.py, pytest format validation, audit logging, comprehensive tests (100% coverage), and SECURITY.md docs

**21:43:50 - auto-implement**: Test-master completed - tests: 100+ tests created (45 in test_security_utils.py, 30 in test_project_md_updater_security.py, 25 in test_agent_tracker_refactor.py), all currently FAILING (TDD red phase), 100% coverage target on security paths

**21:55:22 - auto-implement**: Implementer completed - files: Created security_utils.py (628 lines), modified project_md_updater.py (69% validation code reduction), modified agent_tracker.py (77% validation code reduction), created logs/ directory structure, created comprehensive docs. All integration tests passing (16/16), 200 lines of duplicated code eliminated
